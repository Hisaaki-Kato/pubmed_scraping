FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts obtained from fermenting cassava mash and maize slurry were screened for tolerance to cadmium and lead at 500-1050 mg ml-1 screened for probiotic potentials and antioxidant activities such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and ferric reducing antioxidant properties. The in vivo studies were carried out in male Wistar rats. The strains identified as Lactobacillus plantarum ML05 and Pichia kudriavzevii FY05 demonstrated the best probiotic potentials and antioxidant activities. Alterations in antioxidant capacities were positive in the treatment groups. The histopathology displayed positive changes in the renal tubules and glomeruli, hypertrophy, with normal capsular spaces without inflammation in the kidney, while the liver sinusoids appear normal in the rats administered with L. plantarum ML05 and P. kudriavzevii FY05 while the infected and not treated showed cell necrosis induced by toxicities. Our results provided new evidence that Lactobacillus plantarum and Pichia kudriavzevii have different biological actions on the heavy metals binding capacities and antioxidant activities in experimental animals. This study suggests that these microorganisms can be considered dietary therapeutics against cadmium and lead toxicities."

Here, we have applied an in-house consensus method to stabilize a laboratory evolved high-redox potential laccase. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out and computationally refined by applying relative entropy and mutual information thresholds. Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

In this context, we report that novel hybrid and dimer derivatives of artesunic acid and artemisinin, bearing camptothecin and SN38 as side-chain biological effectors, can inhibit growth of yeast cells overexpressing human topoisomerase 1 and its enzymatic activity in vitro. These derivatives showed also anticancer activity in melanoma cell lines higher than camptothecin and paclitaxel.

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."
32434780,Pseudouridine-mediated stop codon read-through in S. cerevisiae is sequence context-independent.,20200521,"['Adachi Hironori', 'Yu Yi-Tao']","We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

The mammalian Bucentaur/Craniofacial developmental protein 1 (Bcnt/Cfdp1) is also a tentative component of the Srcap (SNF2-Related CBP Activator Protein) chromatin remodeling complex, but little is known about its properties, partly because few antibodies are available to examine the endogenous protein. In this paper, we assigned the western blot signal against the mouse Bcnt/ Cfdp1 as a doublet of approximately 45 kDa using anti-Bcnt/Cfdp1 antibodies, which were generated against either of two unrelated immunogens, BCNT-C domain or mouse N-terminal peptide, and in addition, the Cfdp1 knockdown mouse ES cell line and bovine tissue were used as potential negative controls. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Although they are commensals, under specific conditions they become pathogens, causing skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis in humans, and dermatitis and otitis in dogs. Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta.

Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P 
i
 dynamics, which are assumed to be length- and calcium activity-dependent. Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is essential and required for the endomembrane system functions in eukaryotic cells. Recently, genes encoding eukaryote-like ESCRT protein components have been identified in the genomes of Asgard archaea, a newly proposed archaeal superphylum that is thought to include the closest extant prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."

Upon acute glucose starvation, yeast cells undergo drastic physiological and metabolic changes and reestablish a constant-although lower-level of energy production within minutes. The molecules that are rapidly metabolized to fuel energy production under these conditions are unknown. Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts. When the assay with isolates collected in the year 2016 was first evaluated, the assay showed comparable results with conventional PCR-sequencing method where 34 OXA-48 and OXA-232/OXA-181 were detected. By using HRM analysis, the presence of OXA-48-like variants could be easily identified within 3 hours from the pure culture."

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction.

Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans.

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."
32427463,Small Molecule Channels Harness Membrane Potential to Concentrate Potassium in trk1Δtrk2Δ Yeast.,20200519,"['Hou Jennifer', 'Daniels Page N', 'Burke Martin D']","Many protein ion channels harness membrane potential to move ions in opposition to their chemical gradient. Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth. This finding expands the list of potential human channelopathies that might be addressed by a molecular prosthetics approach."

Sporotrichosis, caused by species of the Sporothrix schenckii complex, is the most prevalent subcutaneous mycosis in many areas of Latin America. Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high sterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterol.Aim. In this study, the antifungal activity of statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) against planktonic cells and biofilms of S. schenckii complex species was evaluated, as well as the interaction of pravastatin with classical antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine).Methodology. Eighteen strains of Sporothrix species were used. The antifungal susceptibility assay was performed using the broth microdilution method. Mature biofilms were exposed to statins and metabolic activity was measured by the XTT reduction assay.Results. MICs of statins ranged from 8 to 512 μg ml-1 and from 8 to 256 μg ml-1 for filamentous and yeast forms, respectively. Regarding mature biofilms, MICs of 50 % inhibition (SMIC50) were 128 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and atorvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for pravastatin. MICs of 90 % inhibition (SMIC90) were 512 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for atorvastatin and pravastatin.Conclusion. These results highlight the antifungal and antibiofilm potential of statins against S. schenckii complex species."
32426863,The actin cytoskeletal network plays a role in yeast prion transmission and contributes to prion stability.,20200519,"['Dorweiler Jane E', 'Oddo Mitchell J', 'Lyke Douglas R', 'Reilly Jacob A', 'Wisniewski Brett T', 'Davis Emily E', 'Kuborn Abigail M', 'Merrill Stephen J', 'Manogaran Anita L']","Chaperone networks are required for the shearing and generation of transmissible propagons from pre-existing prion aggregates. However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

This study aimed to determine the chemical and microbiological characteristics of rabbit meat bekasam during the fermentation process in order to isolate, characterize (in vitro and in vivo), and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as the probiotic candidate. The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was the potential probiotic isolate.

In this study, different electrode materials, namely, nickel, stainless steel, brass, and graphite were used to investigate the energy production in double chamber microbial fuel cells. Yeast microorganisms (MOs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used at different concentrations for electricity production under different operating conditions with glucose as a substrate. The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

The genes acquired by HGT play important roles in yeast adaptation to the fermentation process, improving nitrogen and carbon source utilization. However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

To explain the relation between the change and the expressions of some genes involved in morphological changes of the strain, these were analyzed on the filamentous and yeast cell by real-time qPCR. The compared genes were Nce103, Ras3, Cyr1, Pde, and Efg1 encoding carbonic anhydrase, GTPase, adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and elongation factor G1, respectively. In anaerobic grown yeast cell with 70%N2 + 30%CO2, the Nce103 and Ras3 gene expressions decreased to 24 h whereas that of the filamentous cell increased. However, a downstream gene of Cyr1 expression level in the yeast cell was higher than that of filamentous cell. A lower level of Pde in the yeast cell than that of the filamentous cell indicated intracellular cAMP accumulation. The actual cAMP in the yeast cell remained whereas that of the filamentous cell decreased with cultivation. The Efg1 expression level controlling hyphal elongation was suppressed in the yeast cell.

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays.

32424475,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type.

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms.

Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

In a previous study, we constructed a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae capable of producing three STs; 4,8-dihydroxy-22,23-oxidosqualene (ST-1), 8-hydroxy-2,3;22,23-squalene dioxide (ST-2), and 2,3;22,23-squalene dioxide (ST-3). Here, we first evaluated the effects of these STs on the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and found that ST-3 exhibited the greatest potency compared to the other two STs. To further enhance the bioproduction of ST-3, we adopted a tunable system to balance the expression of the Ganoderma lucidum cytochrome P450 gene CYP505D13 in S. cerevisiae, which significantly improved the ST-3 production titer. The most effective strain produced 78.61 mg/L of ST-3 after 62 h fermentation, which was 6.43 times higher than that of our previous study. The present study demonstrated that ST-3 effectively inhibits the proliferation of NSCLC cells, and provides insight into its efficient bioproduction."
32423670,Engineering and optimization of phosphate-responsive phytase expression in Pichia pastoris yeast for phytate hydrolysis.,20200519,"['Xie Zhenming', 'Fong Wing-Ping', 'Tsang Paul Wai-Kei']","Phytate is the major storage form of phosphorus in plants. It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model. These yeast-based whole cell biocatalysts may serve as platform hosts with potential applications in food processing industry and animal waste treatment."

However, some cellular structures are planar and hence 2D imaging should be sufficient, provided that the structure of interest can be oriented with respect to the optical axis of the microscope. Here, we report a 3D microfabrication method which positions and orients cell divisions very close to the microscope coverglass. We use this approach to study cytokinesis in fission yeasts and polarization to lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cells. We show that this method improves spatial resolution on range of common microscopies, including super-resolution STED. Altogether, this method could shed new lights on self-organization phenomena in single cells and 3D cell culture systems."

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."
32422801,Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: A mechanism for dynamic robustness in the yeast cell-cycle process.,20200519,"['Zhao Yao', 'Wang Dedi', 'Zhang Zhiwen', 'Lu Ying', 'Yang Xiaojing', 'Ouyang Qi', 'Tang Chao', 'Li Fangting']","Biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as the cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and maintain dynamic robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

However, the current manufacturing methods for plant natural products mainly rely on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, which are associated with unsustainability and severe environmental problems. The advancement of genetic technology has facilitated the engineering of microbes for producing plant natural products, but their industrial production titers remain low. Yarrowia lipolytica, a nonconventional yeast, is a promising and superior host for plant natural products manufacture, due to its advanced properties compared to conventional hosts. In this review, metabolic engineering approaches recently employed for overproduction of useful plant natural products, including terpenoids and polyketides, in Y. lipolytica are summarized. The current challenges for the biosynthesis of typical compounds are discussed and promising engineering strategies for future work are also suggested. This review provides guidance for engineering Y. lipolytica as a robust host for plant natural products production."

E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

32421706,Humanization of yeast genes with multiple human orthologs reveals functional divergence between paralogs.,20200518,"['Laurent Jon M', 'Garge Riddhiman K', 'Teufel Ashley I', 'Wilke Claus O', 'Kachroo Aashiq H', 'Marcotte Edward M']","Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications. The described procedure represents a virtuous example of circular economy efficaciously applied for a depleting agri-food resource."

Here, we show that two paralogous transmembrane Rsp5 adaptors, Rcr1 and Rcr2, are sorted to distinct cellular locations: Rcr1 is a plasma membrane (PM) protein, whereas Rcr2 is sorted to the vacuole. Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

The protocol, which is based on in-droplet spheroplasting of the cells, yields an order-of-magnitude higher throughput in comparison to existing methods. After extensive validation of the method, we demonstrate its use by studying the dynamics of the response of isogenic yeast populations to a shift in carbon source, revealing the heterogeneity and underlying molecular processes during this shift.

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

32420623,Plant golgi ultrastructure.,20200518,['Robinson David G'],"The plant Golgi apparatus (sensu lato: Golgi stack + Trans Golgi Network, TGN) is a highly polar and mobile key organelle lying at the junction of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Unlike its counterpart in animal cells it does not disassemble during mitosis. It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Fermentation of cocoa pulp-bean mass is performed mainly in heaps or boxes. It is made possible by a succession of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) activities. Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity.

When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

Improving ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae will increase fermentation efficiency, thereby reducing capital costs. Here, we found that S. cerevisiae strain L exhibited a higher ethanol tolerance (14%, v/v) than the fermentative strain Q (10%, v/v). In order to enhance the strain Q ethanol tolerance but preserve its fermentation property, protoplast fusion was performed with haploids from strain Q and L. The fusant Q/L-f2 with 14% ethanol tolerance was obtained. Meanwhile, the fermentation properties (flocculability, SO2 production, α-N assimilation rate, GSH production, etc.) of Q/L-f2 were similar to those of strain Q. Therefore, our works established a series of high ethanol-tolerant strains in beer production. Moreover, this demonstration of inactivated protoplast fusion in industrial S. cerevisiae strain opens many doors for yeast-based biotechnological applications."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation. Our results suggest that soybean plants coinoculated with these microorganisms might benefit from biocontrol while contributing to soil-nitrogen preservation."

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."
32419301,Homologous recombination and Mus81 promote replication completion in response to replication fork blockage.,20200518,"['Pardo Benjamin', 'Moriel-Carretero María', 'Vicat Thibaud', 'Aguilera Andrés', 'Pasero Philippe']","Impediments to DNA replication threaten genome stability. The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."
32418228,Isolation and characterization of Salt Overly Sensitive family genes in spinach.,20200517,"['Zhao Chaoyang', 'William David', 'Sandhu Devinder']","The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."
32416736,Pseudouridine-mediated stop codon read-through in S. cerevisiae is sequence context-independent.,20200521,"['Adachi Hironori', 'Yu Yi-Tao']","We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

The impact of the encapsulation of Oenococcus oeni into SiO2-alginate hydrogel (Si-ALG) and the addition of lysozyme in wines inoculated with encapsulated bacteria were also analysed. There was a significant influence of the timing of inoculation on the volatile composition of the wines just as on the amino acid and biogenic amine content. The wines produced by simultaneous AF/MLF showed the highest contents of some volatile compounds, such as ethyl esters and terpenes, as well as amino acids and tyramine. Bacterial encapsulation affected the volatile and amino acid profile of the wines, while the biogenic amine composition was not modified. The chemical composition of the wines was not altered by the presence of lysozyme. A trained panel did not perceive substantial differences between treatments."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

The mammalian Bucentaur/Craniofacial developmental protein 1 (Bcnt/Cfdp1) is also a tentative component of the Srcap (SNF2-Related CBP Activator Protein) chromatin remodeling complex, but little is known about its properties, partly because few antibodies are available to examine the endogenous protein. In this paper, we assigned the western blot signal against the mouse Bcnt/ Cfdp1 as a doublet of approximately 45 kDa using anti-Bcnt/Cfdp1 antibodies, which were generated against either of two unrelated immunogens, BCNT-C domain or mouse N-terminal peptide, and in addition, the Cfdp1 knockdown mouse ES cell line and bovine tissue were used as potential negative controls. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Although they are commensals, under specific conditions they become pathogens, causing skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis in humans, and dermatitis and otitis in dogs. Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta. Collectively, data suggested that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY might be positive and negative regulators, respectively in the picrosides biosynthetic pathway."

Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P

Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is essential and required for the endomembrane system functions in eukaryotic cells. Recently, genes encoding eukaryote-like ESCRT protein components have been identified in the genomes of Asgard archaea, a newly proposed archaeal superphylum that is thought to include the closest extant prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."

Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts. When the assay with isolates collected in the year 2016 was first evaluated, the assay showed comparable results with conventional PCR-sequencing method where 34 OXA-48 and OXA-232/OXA-181 were detected. By using HRM analysis, the presence of OXA-48-like variants could be easily identified within 3 hours from the pure culture."

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

The role mediated by beclin 1 is controlled by various conditions and factors. Beclin 1 is regulated at the gene and protein levels by different factors. These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction. This review focuses on the functions of beclin 1, its interacting partners, regulations at gene and protein level, and the role of beclin 1 interactome in relation to various diseases along with the recent developments in the field."

The best-known organelles and major protein families of this system are largely conserved across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, implying both ancient organization and functional unity. Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans. These proteins may well hold clues to understanding differences in cellular function in organisms that are of pressing importance for planetary health."

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."

Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth.

However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was the potential probiotic isolate.

In this study, different electrode materials, namely, nickel, stainless steel, brass, and graphite were used to investigate the energy production in double chamber microbial fuel cells. Yeast microorganisms (MOs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used at different concentrations for electricity production under different operating conditions with glucose as a substrate. The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

In this research, a part of hypothetical mechanism on yeast-like cell induction of M. circinelloides in CO2 atmosphere was reported from the viewpoint of gene expression. To explain the relation between the change and the expressions of some genes involved in morphological changes of the strain, these were analyzed on the filamentous and yeast cell by real-time qPCR. The compared genes were Nce103, Ras3, Cyr1, Pde, and Efg1 encoding carbonic anhydrase, GTPase, adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and elongation factor G1, respectively. In anaerobic grown yeast cell with 70%N2 + 30%CO2, the Nce103 and Ras3 gene expressions decreased to 24 h whereas that of the filamentous cell increased. However, a downstream gene of Cyr1 expression level in the yeast cell was higher than that of filamentous cell. A lower level of Pde in the yeast cell than that of the filamentous cell indicated intracellular cAMP accumulation. The actual cAMP in the yeast cell remained whereas that of the filamentous cell decreased with cultivation. The Efg1 expression level controlling hyphal elongation was suppressed in the yeast cell. The intracellular cAMP accumulation and Efg1 expression regulate hyphal elongation or yeast forming."

The search for new sources of this enzyme has become attractive for therapeutics. Traditional methods for biomolecule purification involve several steps. A two-phase system may be a good strategy to anticipate one of these stages. This study aimed to produce and purify a fungal L-asparaginase through an aqueous two-phase micellar system (ATPMS) using Triton X-114. The fungus Penicillium sp.-encoded 2DSST1 was isolated from Cerrado soil. Plackett-Burman design followed by a 24 full factorial design was used to determine the best conditions to produce L-asparaginase. The evaluated variables were L-asparagine, L-proline, wheat bran, potato dextrose broth, ammonium sulfate, yeast extract, sucrose and glucose concentrations, incubation temperature, incubation period, and initial pH of the culture medium. L-asparaginase quantification was valued by the formation of β-aspartyl hydroxamate. The significant positive variables, L-asparagine, L-proline, potato dextrose broth, and sucrose concentrations, were evaluated at 2 levels (+ 1 and - 1) with triplicate of the central point. After 34 runs, maximum activity (2.33 IU/mL) was achieved at the factorial design central point. A central composite design was performed in ATPMS at two levels (+ 1 and - 1) varying Triton X-114 concentration (w/v), separation phase temperature, and crude extract concentration (w/v). The L-asparaginase partition coefficient (K) was considered the experimental design response. Out of the 16 systems that were examined, the most promising presented a purification factor of 1.4 and a yield of 100%."

Plackett-Burman method was used to select twelve effective factors including pH, inoculum size, temperature, time, corn starch, KH2PO4, peptone, MgSO4, CaCl2, NaCl, glycerin, and yeast extract concentrations on bacterial alpha-amylases production yield. The Box-Behnken method was utilized to optimize the level of selected significant factors. The stability of bacterial alpha-amylases was also determined in low pH and high-temperature conditions. In addition, in silico study was used to create the alpha-amylase structure and study the stability in high-temperature and low water available condition. Among all isolated and characterized microorganisms, Bacillus megaterium produced the highest amount of alpha-amylases. The in silico data showed the enzyme 3D structure similarity to alpha-amylase from Halothermothrix orenii and highly negative charge amino acids on its surface caused the enzyme activity and stability in low water conditions. Based on Box-Behnken results, the temperature 35 °C, pH 6 and starch 40 g/l were determined as the optimum level of significant factors to achieve the highest alpha-amylases unit (101.44 U/ml). This bacterial alpha-amylases enzyme showed stability at pH 5 and a range of temperatures from 40 to 60 °C that indicates this enzyme may possess the potential for using in industrial processes."

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays. Consequently, A. resinae KUC3009 can be a promising candidate for scalable production of industrially applicable melanin."
32408794,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of VopQ bound to the Vo subcomplex of the V-ATPase. VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model.

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."

Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

32405802,Humanization of yeast genes with multiple human orthologs reveals functional divergence between paralogs.,20200518,"['Laurent Jon M', 'Garge Riddhiman K', 'Teufel Ashley I', 'Wilke Claus O', 'Kachroo Aashiq H', 'Marcotte Edward M']","Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications. The described procedure represents a virtuous example of circular economy efficaciously applied for a depleting agri-food resource."

Here, we show that two paralogous transmembrane Rsp5 adaptors, Rcr1 and Rcr2, are sorted to distinct cellular locations: Rcr1 is a plasma membrane (PM) protein, whereas Rcr2 is sorted to the vacuole. Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

The protocol, which is based on in-droplet spheroplasting of the cells, yields an order-of-magnitude higher throughput in comparison to existing methods. After extensive validation of the method, we demonstrate its use by studying the dynamics of the response of isogenic yeast populations to a shift in carbon source, revealing the heterogeneity and underlying molecular processes during this shift.

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

32403297,Plant golgi ultrastructure.,20200518,['Robinson David G'],"The plant Golgi apparatus (sensu lato: Golgi stack + Trans Golgi Network, TGN) is a highly polar and mobile key organelle lying at the junction of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Unlike its counterpart in animal cells it does not disassemble during mitosis. It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Fermentation of cocoa pulp-bean mass is performed mainly in heaps or boxes. It is made possible by a succession of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) activities. Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to uncover the role of vanillin (Van), a natural food flavoring agent, in inhibiting GC, yeast-to-hyphal transition, and biofilm formation in human fungal pathogen C. albicans."

In this study the inhibition of glucose-induced proton release was determined on the basis of color change of pH indicator, methyl red, from pH 5 to pH6 at cell density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation.

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

32400853,In vitro screening of technical lignins to determine their potential as hay preservatives.,20200518,"['Reyes D C', 'Annis S L', 'Rivera S A', 'Leon-Tinoco A Y', 'Wu C', 'Perkins L B', 'Perry J J', 'Ma Z X', 'Knight C W', 'Castillo M S', 'Romero J J']","Our objectives were to evaluate technical lignins for their antifungal properties against 3 molds and 1 yeast causing hay spoilage, and their ability to preserve ground high-moisture alfalfa hay nutritive value in vitro. In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."

This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."
32397551,Pseudouridine-mediated stop codon read-through in S. cerevisiae is sequence context-independent.,20200521,"['Adachi Hironori', 'Yu Yi-Tao']","We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

The present work showed the functionality of WRKY motifs (TGAC cis-acting elements) present in the promoters of regulatory genes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Pkhmgr) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (Pkdxs) of the picrosides biosynthetic pathway by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta. Collectively, data suggested that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY might be positive and negative regulators, respectively in the picrosides biosynthetic pathway."
32396563,Stress Tolerance of Yeasts Dominating Reverse Osmosis Membranes for Whey Water Treatment.,20200520,"['Vitzilaiou Eirini', 'Aunsbjerg Stina D', 'Mahyudin N A', 'Knøchel Susanne']","Filamentous yeast species belonging to the closely related Saprochaete clavata and Magnusiomyces spicifer were recently found to dominate biofilm communities on the retentate and permeate surface of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes used in a whey water treatment system after CIP (Cleaning-In-Place). Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P 
i
 dynamics, which are assumed to be length- and calcium activity-dependent. Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is essential and required for the endomembrane system functions in eukaryotic cells. Recently, genes encoding eukaryote-like ESCRT protein components have been identified in the genomes of Asgard archaea, a newly proposed archaeal superphylum that is thought to include the closest extant prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."

Upon acute glucose starvation, yeast cells undergo drastic physiological and metabolic changes and reestablish a constant-although lower-level of energy production within minutes. The molecules that are rapidly metabolized to fuel energy production under these conditions are unknown. Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts. When the assay with isolates collected in the year 2016 was first evaluated, the assay showed comparable results with conventional PCR-sequencing method where 34 OXA-48 and OXA-232/OXA-181 were detected. By using HRM analysis, the presence of OXA-48-like variants could be easily identified within 3 hours from the pure culture."

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

The role mediated by beclin 1 is controlled by various conditions and factors. Beclin 1 is regulated at the gene and protein levels by different factors. These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction. This review focuses on the functions of beclin 1, its interacting partners, regulations at gene and protein level, and the role of beclin 1 interactome in relation to various diseases along with the recent developments in the field."

The best-known organelles and major protein families of this system are largely conserved across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, implying both ancient organization and functional unity. Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans. These proteins may well hold clues to understanding differences in cellular function in organisms that are of pressing importance for planetary health."

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."
32392269,Small Molecule Channels Harness Membrane Potential to Concentrate Potassium in trk1Δtrk2Δ Yeast.,20200519,"['Hou Jennifer', 'Daniels Page N', 'Burke Martin D']","Many protein ion channels harness membrane potential to move ions in opposition to their chemical gradient. Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth. This finding expands the list of potential human channelopathies that might be addressed by a molecular prosthetics approach."

Sporotrichosis, caused by species of the Sporothrix schenckii complex, is the most prevalent subcutaneous mycosis in many areas of Latin America. Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high sterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterol.Aim. In this study, the antifungal activity of statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) against planktonic cells and biofilms of S. schenckii complex species was evaluated, as well as the interaction of pravastatin with classical antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine).Methodology. Eighteen strains of Sporothrix species were used. The antifungal susceptibility assay was performed using the broth microdilution method. Mature biofilms were exposed to statins and metabolic activity was measured by the XTT reduction assay.Results. MICs of statins ranged from 8 to 512 μg ml-1 and from 8 to 256 μg ml-1 for filamentous and yeast forms, respectively. Regarding mature biofilms, MICs of 50 % inhibition (SMIC50) were 128 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and atorvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for pravastatin. MICs of 90 % inhibition (SMIC90) were 512 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for atorvastatin and pravastatin.Conclusion. These results highlight the antifungal and antibiofilm potential of statins against S. schenckii complex species."
32392142,The actin cytoskeletal network plays a role in yeast prion transmission and contributes to prion stability.,20200519,"['Dorweiler Jane E', 'Oddo Mitchell J', 'Lyke Douglas R', 'Reilly Jacob A', 'Wisniewski Brett T', 'Davis Emily E', 'Kuborn Abigail M', 'Merrill Stephen J', 'Manogaran Anita L']","Chaperone networks are required for the shearing and generation of transmissible propagons from pre-existing prion aggregates. However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

This study aimed to determine the chemical and microbiological characteristics of rabbit meat bekasam during the fermentation process in order to isolate, characterize (in vitro and in vivo), and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as the probiotic candidate. The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g).

In this study, different electrode materials, namely, nickel, stainless steel, brass, and graphite were used to investigate the energy production in double chamber microbial fuel cells. Yeast microorganisms (MOs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used at different concentrations for electricity production under different operating conditions with glucose as a substrate. The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

The genes acquired by HGT play important roles in yeast adaptation to the fermentation process, improving nitrogen and carbon source utilization. However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays.

32390989,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of VopQ bound to the Vo subcomplex of the V-ATPase. VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

Here, we first evaluated the effects of these STs on the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and found that ST-3 exhibited the greatest potency compared to the other two STs. To further enhance the bioproduction of ST-3, we adopted a tunable system to balance the expression of the Ganoderma lucidum cytochrome P450 gene CYP505D13 in S. cerevisiae, which significantly improved the ST-3 production titer.

It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model. These yeast-based whole cell biocatalysts may serve as platform hosts with potential applications in food processing industry and animal waste treatment."

Here, we report a 3D microfabrication method which positions and orients cell divisions very close to the microscope coverglass. We use this approach to study cytokinesis in fission yeasts and polarization to lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cells. We show that this method improves spatial resolution on range of common microscopies, including super-resolution STED. Altogether, this method could shed new lights on self-organization phenomena in single cells and 3D cell culture systems."

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."
32388605,Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: A mechanism for dynamic robustness in the yeast cell-cycle process.,20200519,"['Zhao Yao', 'Wang Dedi', 'Zhang Zhiwen', 'Lu Ying', 'Yang Xiaojing', 'Ouyang Qi', 'Tang Chao', 'Li Fangting']","Biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as the cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and maintain dynamic robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

Yarrowia lipolytica, a nonconventional yeast, is a promising and superior host for plant natural products manufacture, due to its advanced properties compared to conventional hosts. In this review, metabolic engineering approaches recently employed for overproduction of useful plant natural products, including terpenoids and polyketides, in Y. lipolytica are summarized. The current challenges for the biosynthesis of typical compounds are discussed and promising engineering strategies for future work are also suggested. This review provides guidance for engineering Y. lipolytica as a robust host for plant natural products production."

E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications. The described procedure represents a virtuous example of circular economy efficaciously applied for a depleting agri-food resource."

Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

32387406,Plant golgi ultrastructure.,20200518,['Robinson David G'],"The plant Golgi apparatus (sensu lato: Golgi stack + Trans Golgi Network, TGN) is a highly polar and mobile key organelle lying at the junction of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Unlike its counterpart in animal cells it does not disassemble during mitosis. It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to uncover the role of vanillin (Van), a natural food flavoring agent, in inhibiting GC, yeast-to-hyphal transition, and biofilm formation in human fungal pathogen C. albicans."
32386229,Visual and simple determination of glucose-induced acidification by yeast cells: application to rapid cytotoxicity test.,20200518,"['Yamashoji Shiro', 'Al Mamun Arafat', 'Bari Latiful']","This study demonstrated that glucose-induced proton release from yeast cells was more sensitive to various inhibitors than cell proliferation. In this study the inhibition of glucose-induced proton release was determined on the basis of color change of pH indicator, methyl red, from pH 5 to pH6 at cell density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

Improving ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae will increase fermentation efficiency, thereby reducing capital costs. Here, we found that S. cerevisiae strain L exhibited a higher ethanol tolerance (14%, v/v) than the fermentative strain Q (10%, v/v). In order to enhance the strain Q ethanol tolerance but preserve its fermentation property, protoplast fusion was performed with haploids from strain Q and L. The fusant Q/L-f2 with 14% ethanol tolerance was obtained. Meanwhile, the fermentation properties (flocculability, SO2 production, α-N assimilation rate, GSH production, etc.) of Q/L-f2 were similar to those of strain Q. Therefore, our works established a series of high ethanol-tolerant strains in beer production. Moreover, this demonstration of inactivated protoplast fusion in industrial S. cerevisiae strain opens many doors for yeast-based biotechnological applications."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation. Our results suggest that soybean plants coinoculated with these microorganisms might benefit from biocontrol while contributing to soil-nitrogen preservation."

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."
32384871,Isolation and characterization of Salt Overly Sensitive family genes in spinach.,20200517,"['Zhao Chaoyang', 'William David', 'Sandhu Devinder']","The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

The mechanism of action of these compounds is associated with the formation of reactive radical species by cleavage of the sesquiterpene pharmacophore endoperoxide bridge. Here we suggested topoisomerase 1 as a possible molecular target for the improvement of the anticancer activity of these compounds. In this context, we report that novel hybrid and dimer derivatives of artesunic acid and artemisinin, bearing camptothecin and SN38 as side-chain biological effectors, can inhibit growth of yeast cells overexpressing human topoisomerase 1 and its enzymatic activity in vitro. These derivatives showed also anticancer activity in melanoma cell lines higher than camptothecin and paclitaxel. In silico molecular docking calculations highlighted a common binding mode for the novel derivatives, with the sesquiterpene lactone scaffold being located near the traditional recognition site for camptothecin, while the bioactive side-chain effector laid in the camptothecin cleft."

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."
32381615,Pseudouridine-mediated stop codon read-through in S. cerevisiae is sequence context-independent.,20200521,"['Adachi Hironori', 'Yu Yi-Tao']","We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

There was a significant influence of the timing of inoculation on the volatile composition of the wines just as on the amino acid and biogenic amine content. The wines produced by simultaneous AF/MLF showed the highest contents of some volatile compounds, such as ethyl esters and terpenes, as well as amino acids and tyramine. Bacterial encapsulation affected the volatile and amino acid profile of the wines, while the biogenic amine composition was not modified. The chemical composition of the wines was not altered by the presence of lysozyme. A trained panel did not perceive substantial differences between treatments."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

The mammalian Bucentaur/Craniofacial developmental protein 1 (Bcnt/Cfdp1) is also a tentative component of the Srcap (SNF2-Related CBP Activator Protein) chromatin remodeling complex, but little is known about its properties, partly because few antibodies are available to examine the endogenous protein. In this paper, we assigned the western blot signal against the mouse Bcnt/ Cfdp1 as a doublet of approximately 45 kDa using anti-Bcnt/Cfdp1 antibodies, which were generated against either of two unrelated immunogens, BCNT-C domain or mouse N-terminal peptide, and in addition, the Cfdp1 knockdown mouse ES cell line and bovine tissue were used as potential negative controls. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Although they are commensals, under specific conditions they become pathogens, causing skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis in humans, and dermatitis and otitis in dogs. Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta.

Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P

Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."
32376676,β-Oxidation and autophagy are critical energy providers during acute glucose depletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,20200520,"['Weber Carmen A', 'Sekar Karthik', 'Tang Jeffrey H', 'Warmer Philipp', 'Sauer Uwe', 'Weis Karsten']","The ability to tolerate and thrive in diverse environments is paramount to all living organisms, and many organisms spend a large part of their lifetime in starvation. Upon acute glucose starvation, yeast cells undergo drastic physiological and metabolic changes and reestablish a constant-although lower-level of energy production within minutes. The molecules that are rapidly metabolized to fuel energy production under these conditions are unknown. Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts. When the assay with isolates collected in the year 2016 was first evaluated, the assay showed comparable results with conventional PCR-sequencing method where 34 OXA-48 and OXA-232/OXA-181 were detected. By using HRM analysis, the presence of OXA-48-like variants could be easily identified within 3 hours from the pure culture."

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

The role mediated by beclin 1 is controlled by various conditions and factors. Beclin 1 is regulated at the gene and protein levels by different factors. These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction. This review focuses on the functions of beclin 1, its interacting partners, regulations at gene and protein level, and the role of beclin 1 interactome in relation to various diseases along with the recent developments in the field."

The best-known organelles and major protein families of this system are largely conserved across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, implying both ancient organization and functional unity. Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans. These proteins may well hold clues to understanding differences in cellular function in organisms that are of pressing importance for planetary health."

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."

Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth.

Sporotrichosis, caused by species of the Sporothrix schenckii complex, is the most prevalent subcutaneous mycosis in many areas of Latin America. Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high sterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterol.Aim. In this study, the antifungal activity of statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) against planktonic cells and biofilms of S. schenckii complex species was evaluated, as well as the interaction of pravastatin with classical antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine).Methodology. Eighteen strains of Sporothrix species were used. The antifungal susceptibility assay was performed using the broth microdilution method. Mature biofilms were exposed to statins and metabolic activity was measured by the XTT reduction assay.Results. MICs of statins ranged from 8 to 512 μg ml-1 and from 8 to 256 μg ml-1 for filamentous and yeast forms, respectively. Regarding mature biofilms, MICs of 50 % inhibition (SMIC50) were 128 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and atorvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for pravastatin. MICs of 90 % inhibition (SMIC90) were 512 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for atorvastatin and pravastatin.Conclusion.

32373928,The actin cytoskeletal network plays a role in yeast prion transmission and contributes to prion stability.,20200519,"['Dorweiler Jane E', 'Oddo Mitchell J', 'Lyke Douglas R', 'Reilly Jacob A', 'Wisniewski Brett T', 'Davis Emily E', 'Kuborn Abigail M', 'Merrill Stephen J', 'Manogaran Anita L']","Chaperone networks are required for the shearing and generation of transmissible propagons from pre-existing prion aggregates. However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was the potential probiotic isolate.

The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

The genes acquired by HGT play important roles in yeast adaptation to the fermentation process, improving nitrogen and carbon source utilization. However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

In this research, a part of hypothetical mechanism on yeast-like cell induction of M. circinelloides in CO2 atmosphere was reported from the viewpoint of gene expression. To explain the relation between the change and the expressions of some genes involved in morphological changes of the strain, these were analyzed on the filamentous and yeast cell by real-time qPCR. The compared genes were Nce103, Ras3, Cyr1, Pde, and Efg1 encoding carbonic anhydrase, GTPase, adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and elongation factor G1, respectively. In anaerobic grown yeast cell with 70%N2 + 30%CO2, the Nce103 and Ras3 gene expressions decreased to 24 h whereas that of the filamentous cell increased. However, a downstream gene of Cyr1 expression level in the yeast cell was higher than that of filamentous cell. A lower level of Pde in the yeast cell than that of the filamentous cell indicated intracellular cAMP accumulation. The actual cAMP in the yeast cell remained whereas that of the filamentous cell decreased with cultivation. The Efg1 expression level controlling hyphal elongation was suppressed in the yeast cell. The intracellular cAMP accumulation and Efg1 expression regulate hyphal elongation or yeast forming."

This study aimed to produce and purify a fungal L-asparaginase through an aqueous two-phase micellar system (ATPMS) using Triton X-114. The fungus Penicillium sp.-encoded 2DSST1 was isolated from Cerrado soil. Plackett-Burman design followed by a 24 full factorial design was used to determine the best conditions to produce L-asparaginase. The evaluated variables were L-asparagine, L-proline, wheat bran, potato dextrose broth, ammonium sulfate, yeast extract, sucrose and glucose concentrations, incubation temperature, incubation period, and initial pH of the culture medium. L-asparaginase quantification was valued by the formation of β-aspartyl hydroxamate. The significant positive variables, L-asparagine, L-proline, potato dextrose broth, and sucrose concentrations, were evaluated at 2 levels (+ 1 and - 1) with triplicate of the central point. After 34 runs, maximum activity (2.33 IU/mL) was achieved at the factorial design central point. A central composite design was performed in ATPMS at two levels (+ 1 and - 1) varying Triton X-114 concentration (w/v), separation phase temperature, and crude extract concentration (w/v).

The Box-Behnken method was utilized to optimize the level of selected significant factors. The stability of bacterial alpha-amylases was also determined in low pH and high-temperature conditions. In addition, in silico study was used to create the alpha-amylase structure and study the stability in high-temperature and low water available condition. Among all isolated and characterized microorganisms, Bacillus megaterium produced the highest amount of alpha-amylases. The in silico data showed the enzyme 3D structure similarity to alpha-amylase from Halothermothrix orenii and highly negative charge amino acids on its surface caused the enzyme activity and stability in low water conditions. Based on Box-Behnken results, the temperature 35 °C, pH 6 and starch 40 g/l were determined as the optimum level of significant factors to achieve the highest alpha-amylases unit (101.44 U/ml).

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays. Consequently, A. resinae KUC3009 can be a promising candidate for scalable production of industrially applicable melanin."
32372125,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model.

We use this approach to study cytokinesis in fission yeasts and polarization to lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cells.

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."
32370929,Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: A mechanism for dynamic robustness in the yeast cell-cycle process.,20200519,"['Zhao Yao', 'Wang Dedi', 'Zhang Zhiwen', 'Lu Ying', 'Yang Xiaojing', 'Ouyang Qi', 'Tang Chao', 'Li Fangting']","Biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as the cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and maintain dynamic robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

However, the current manufacturing methods for plant natural products mainly rely on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, which are associated with unsustainability and severe environmental problems. The advancement of genetic technology has facilitated the engineering of microbes for producing plant natural products, but their industrial production titers remain low. Yarrowia lipolytica, a nonconventional yeast, is a promising and superior host for plant natural products manufacture, due to its advanced properties compared to conventional hosts. In this review, metabolic engineering approaches recently employed for overproduction of useful plant natural products, including terpenoids and polyketides, in Y. lipolytica are summarized. The current challenges for the biosynthesis of typical compounds are discussed and promising engineering strategies for future work are also suggested. This review provides guidance for engineering Y. lipolytica as a robust host for plant natural products production."

E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

32370232,Humanization of yeast genes with multiple human orthologs reveals functional divergence between paralogs.,20200518,"['Laurent Jon M', 'Garge Riddhiman K', 'Teufel Ashley I', 'Wilke Claus O', 'Kachroo Aashiq H', 'Marcotte Edward M']","Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications. The described procedure represents a virtuous example of circular economy efficaciously applied for a depleting agri-food resource."

Here, we show that two paralogous transmembrane Rsp5 adaptors, Rcr1 and Rcr2, are sorted to distinct cellular locations: Rcr1 is a plasma membrane (PM) protein, whereas Rcr2 is sorted to the vacuole. Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

The protocol, which is based on in-droplet spheroplasting of the cells, yields an order-of-magnitude higher throughput in comparison to existing methods. After extensive validation of the method, we demonstrate its use by studying the dynamics of the response of isogenic yeast populations to a shift in carbon source, revealing the heterogeneity and underlying molecular processes during this shift.

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

32369912,Plant golgi ultrastructure.,20200518,['Robinson David G'],"The plant Golgi apparatus (sensu lato: Golgi stack + Trans Golgi Network, TGN) is a highly polar and mobile key organelle lying at the junction of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Unlike its counterpart in animal cells it does not disassemble during mitosis. It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

32369582,Overexpression of Populus transcription factor PtrTALE12 increases axillary shoot development by regulating WUSCHEL expression.,20200518,"['Bae So-Young', 'Kim Min-Ha', 'Cho Jin-Seong', 'Park Eung-Jun', 'Lee Hyoshin', 'Kim Jeong-Hoe', 'Ko Jae-Heung']","The TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) transcription factor family has been shown to control meristem formation and organogenesis in plants. To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Fermentation of cocoa pulp-bean mass is performed mainly in heaps or boxes. It is made possible by a succession of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) activities. Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to uncover the role of vanillin (Van), a natural food flavoring agent, in inhibiting GC, yeast-to-hyphal transition, and biofilm formation in human fungal pathogen C. albicans."

In this study the inhibition of glucose-induced proton release was determined on the basis of color change of pH indicator, methyl red, from pH 5 to pH6 at cell density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

In order to enhance the strain Q ethanol tolerance but preserve its fermentation property, protoplast fusion was performed with haploids from strain Q and L. The fusant Q/L-f2 with 14% ethanol tolerance was obtained. Meanwhile, the fermentation properties (flocculability, SO2 production, α-N assimilation rate, GSH production, etc.) of Q/L-f2 were similar to those of strain Q. Therefore, our works established a series of high ethanol-tolerant strains in beer production. Moreover, this demonstration of inactivated protoplast fusion in industrial S. cerevisiae strain opens many doors for yeast-based biotechnological applications."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation. Our results suggest that soybean plants coinoculated with these microorganisms might benefit from biocontrol while contributing to soil-nitrogen preservation."

While GIs have been systematically mapped in yeast, there is scarce information about them in humans. Recently, we have suggested a state-of-the-art hierarchical method that leverages gene ontology information for predicting GIs in yeast. Here, we adapt this method and apply it for the first time to predict GIs in human. We introduce a web service called G2G for this task that is available at http://bnet.cs.tau.ac.il/g2g/."

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."

This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Multiple sequence alignments were carried out and computationally refined by applying relative entropy and mutual information thresholds. Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."

However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Although they are commensals, under specific conditions they become pathogens, causing skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis in humans, and dermatitis and otitis in dogs. Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

The present work showed the functionality of WRKY motifs (TGAC cis-acting elements) present in the promoters of regulatory genes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Pkhmgr) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (Pkdxs) of the picrosides biosynthetic pathway by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta. Collectively, data suggested that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY might be positive and negative regulators, respectively in the picrosides biosynthetic pathway."
32361645,Stress Tolerance of Yeasts Dominating Reverse Osmosis Membranes for Whey Water Treatment.,20200520,"['Vitzilaiou Eirini', 'Aunsbjerg Stina D', 'Mahyudin N A', 'Knøchel Susanne']","Filamentous yeast species belonging to the closely related Saprochaete clavata and Magnusiomyces spicifer were recently found to dominate biofilm communities on the retentate and permeate surface of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes used in a whey water treatment system after CIP (Cleaning-In-Place). Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P 
i
 dynamics, which are assumed to be length- and calcium activity-dependent. Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is essential and required for the endomembrane system functions in eukaryotic cells. Recently, genes encoding eukaryote-like ESCRT protein components have been identified in the genomes of Asgard archaea, a newly proposed archaeal superphylum that is thought to include the closest extant prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."

Upon acute glucose starvation, yeast cells undergo drastic physiological and metabolic changes and reestablish a constant-although lower-level of energy production within minutes. The molecules that are rapidly metabolized to fuel energy production under these conditions are unknown. Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts.

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

The function of beclin 1 depends on the interaction with several autophagy-related genes (Atgs) and other proteins during the autophagy process. The role mediated by beclin 1 is controlled by various conditions and factors. Beclin 1 is regulated at the gene and protein levels by different factors. These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction. This review focuses on the functions of beclin 1, its interacting partners, regulations at gene and protein level, and the role of beclin 1 interactome in relation to various diseases along with the recent developments in the field."

The best-known organelles and major protein families of this system are largely conserved across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, implying both ancient organization and functional unity. Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans. These proteins may well hold clues to understanding differences in cellular function in organisms that are of pressing importance for planetary health."

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."
32357148,Small Molecule Channels Harness Membrane Potential to Concentrate Potassium in trk1Δtrk2Δ Yeast.,20200519,"['Hou Jennifer', 'Daniels Page N', 'Burke Martin D']","Many protein ion channels harness membrane potential to move ions in opposition to their chemical gradient. Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth. This finding expands the list of potential human channelopathies that might be addressed by a molecular prosthetics approach."

Sporotrichosis, caused by species of the Sporothrix schenckii complex, is the most prevalent subcutaneous mycosis in many areas of Latin America. Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high sterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterol.Aim. In this study, the antifungal activity of statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) against planktonic cells and biofilms of S. schenckii complex species was evaluated, as well as the interaction of pravastatin with classical antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine).Methodology. Eighteen strains of Sporothrix species were used. The antifungal susceptibility assay was performed using the broth microdilution method. Mature biofilms were exposed to statins and metabolic activity was measured by the XTT reduction assay.Results. MICs of statins ranged from 8 to 512 μg ml-1 and from 8 to 256 μg ml-1 for filamentous and yeast forms, respectively. Regarding mature biofilms, MICs of 50 % inhibition (SMIC50) were 128 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and atorvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for pravastatin. MICs of 90 % inhibition (SMIC90) were 512 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for atorvastatin and pravastatin.Conclusion. These results highlight the antifungal and antibiofilm potential of statins against S. schenckii complex species."
32356874,The actin cytoskeletal network plays a role in yeast prion transmission and contributes to prion stability.,20200519,"['Dorweiler Jane E', 'Oddo Mitchell J', 'Lyke Douglas R', 'Reilly Jacob A', 'Wisniewski Brett T', 'Davis Emily E', 'Kuborn Abigail M', 'Merrill Stephen J', 'Manogaran Anita L']","Chaperone networks are required for the shearing and generation of transmissible propagons from pre-existing prion aggregates. However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

This study aimed to determine the chemical and microbiological characteristics of rabbit meat bekasam during the fermentation process in order to isolate, characterize (in vitro and in vivo), and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as the probiotic candidate. The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g).

In this study, different electrode materials, namely, nickel, stainless steel, brass, and graphite were used to investigate the energy production in double chamber microbial fuel cells. Yeast microorganisms (MOs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used at different concentrations for electricity production under different operating conditions with glucose as a substrate. The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

The genes acquired by HGT play important roles in yeast adaptation to the fermentation process, improving nitrogen and carbon source utilization. However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays. Consequently, A. resinae KUC3009 can be a promising candidate for scalable production of industrially applicable melanin."
32353964,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli bacteria and a yeast Candida albicans, grown on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V alloy used in the manufacture of prosthetic implants, were employed. Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of VopQ bound to the Vo subcomplex of the V-ATPase. VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

Here, we first evaluated the effects of these STs on the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and found that ST-3 exhibited the greatest potency compared to the other two STs. To further enhance the bioproduction of ST-3, we adopted a tunable system to balance the expression of the Ganoderma lucidum cytochrome P450 gene CYP505D13 in S. cerevisiae, which significantly improved the ST-3 production titer. The most effective strain produced 78.61 mg/L of ST-3 after 62 h fermentation, which was 6.43 times higher than that of our previous study.

It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model. These yeast-based whole cell biocatalysts may serve as platform hosts with potential applications in food processing industry and animal waste treatment."

However, some cellular structures are planar and hence 2D imaging should be sufficient, provided that the structure of interest can be oriented with respect to the optical axis of the microscope. Here, we report a 3D microfabrication method which positions and orients cell divisions very close to the microscope coverglass. We use this approach to study cytokinesis in fission yeasts and polarization to lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cells. We show that this method improves spatial resolution on range of common microscopies, including super-resolution STED. Altogether, this method could shed new lights on self-organization phenomena in single cells and 3D cell culture systems."

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."
32351902,Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: A mechanism for dynamic robustness in the yeast cell-cycle process.,20200519,"['Zhao Yao', 'Wang Dedi', 'Zhang Zhiwen', 'Lu Ying', 'Yang Xiaojing', 'Ouyang Qi', 'Tang Chao', 'Li Fangting']","Biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as the cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and maintain dynamic robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

Yarrowia lipolytica, a nonconventional yeast, is a promising and superior host for plant natural products manufacture, due to its advanced properties compared to conventional hosts. In this review, metabolic engineering approaches recently employed for overproduction of useful plant natural products, including terpenoids and polyketides, in Y. lipolytica are summarized.

E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications.

Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Fermentation of cocoa pulp-bean mass is performed mainly in heaps or boxes. It is made possible by a succession of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) activities. Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to uncover the role of vanillin (Van), a natural food flavoring agent, in inhibiting GC, yeast-to-hyphal transition, and biofilm formation in human fungal pathogen C. albicans."

In this study the inhibition of glucose-induced proton release was determined on the basis of color change of pH indicator, methyl red, from pH 5 to pH6 at cell density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

Improving ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae will increase fermentation efficiency, thereby reducing capital costs. Here, we found that S. cerevisiae strain L exhibited a higher ethanol tolerance (14%, v/v) than the fermentative strain Q (10%, v/v). In order to enhance the strain Q ethanol tolerance but preserve its fermentation property, protoplast fusion was performed with haploids from strain Q and L. The fusant Q/L-f2 with 14% ethanol tolerance was obtained. Meanwhile, the fermentation properties (flocculability, SO2 production, α-N assimilation rate, GSH production, etc.) of Q/L-f2 were similar to those of strain Q. Therefore, our works established a series of high ethanol-tolerant strains in beer production. Moreover, this demonstration of inactivated protoplast fusion in industrial S. cerevisiae strain opens many doors for yeast-based biotechnological applications."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation. Our results suggest that soybean plants coinoculated with these microorganisms might benefit from biocontrol while contributing to soil-nitrogen preservation."

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."
32347408,Isolation and characterization of Salt Overly Sensitive family genes in spinach.,20200517,"['Zhao Chaoyang', 'William David', 'Sandhu Devinder']","The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form.

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts obtained from fermenting cassava mash and maize slurry were screened for tolerance to cadmium and lead at 500-1050 mg ml-1 screened for probiotic potentials and antioxidant activities such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and ferric reducing antioxidant properties. The in vivo studies were carried out in male Wistar rats. The strains identified as Lactobacillus plantarum ML05 and Pichia kudriavzevii FY05 demonstrated the best probiotic potentials and antioxidant activities. Alterations in antioxidant capacities were positive in the treatment groups. The histopathology displayed positive changes in the renal tubules and glomeruli, hypertrophy, with normal capsular spaces without inflammation in the kidney, while the liver sinusoids appear normal in the rats administered with L. plantarum ML05 and P. kudriavzevii FY05 while the infected and not treated showed cell necrosis induced by toxicities. Our results provided new evidence that Lactobacillus plantarum and Pichia kudriavzevii have different biological actions on the heavy metals binding capacities and antioxidant activities in experimental animals. This study suggests that these microorganisms can be considered dietary therapeutics against cadmium and lead toxicities."

Here, we have applied an in-house consensus method to stabilize a laboratory evolved high-redox potential laccase. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out and computationally refined by applying relative entropy and mutual information thresholds. Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

In this context, we report that novel hybrid and dimer derivatives of artesunic acid and artemisinin, bearing camptothecin and SN38 as side-chain biological effectors, can inhibit growth of yeast cells overexpressing human topoisomerase 1 and its enzymatic activity in vitro. These derivatives showed also anticancer activity in melanoma cell lines higher than camptothecin and paclitaxel.

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."
32345492,Pseudouridine-mediated stop codon read-through in S. cerevisiae is sequence context-independent.,20200521,"['Adachi Hironori', 'Yu Yi-Tao']","We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

The mammalian Bucentaur/Craniofacial developmental protein 1 (Bcnt/Cfdp1) is also a tentative component of the Srcap (SNF2-Related CBP Activator Protein) chromatin remodeling complex, but little is known about its properties, partly because few antibodies are available to examine the endogenous protein. In this paper, we assigned the western blot signal against the mouse Bcnt/ Cfdp1 as a doublet of approximately 45 kDa using anti-Bcnt/Cfdp1 antibodies, which were generated against either of two unrelated immunogens, BCNT-C domain or mouse N-terminal peptide, and in addition, the Cfdp1 knockdown mouse ES cell line and bovine tissue were used as potential negative controls. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Although they are commensals, under specific conditions they become pathogens, causing skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis in humans, and dermatitis and otitis in dogs. Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability.

Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P 
i
 dynamics, which are assumed to be length- and calcium activity-dependent. Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is essential and required for the endomembrane system functions in eukaryotic cells. Recently, genes encoding eukaryote-like ESCRT protein components have been identified in the genomes of Asgard archaea, a newly proposed archaeal superphylum that is thought to include the closest extant prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."
32342007,β-Oxidation and autophagy are critical energy providers during acute glucose depletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,20200520,"['Weber Carmen A', 'Sekar Karthik', 'Tang Jeffrey H', 'Warmer Philipp', 'Sauer Uwe', 'Weis Karsten']","The ability to tolerate and thrive in diverse environments is paramount to all living organisms, and many organisms spend a large part of their lifetime in starvation. Upon acute glucose starvation, yeast cells undergo drastic physiological and metabolic changes and reestablish a constant-although lower-level of energy production within minutes. The molecules that are rapidly metabolized to fuel energy production under these conditions are unknown. Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."
32341169,Thiol Peroxidases as Major Regulators of Intracellular Levels of Peroxynitrite in Live Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cells.,20200520,"['Condeles André Luís', 'Gomes Fernando', 'de Oliveira Marcos Antonio', 'Soares Netto Luís Eduardo', 'Toledo Junior José Carlos']","Thiol peroxidases (TP) are ubiquitous and abundant antioxidant proteins of the peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase families that can catalytically and rapidly reduce biologically relevant peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite. However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts. When the assay with isolates collected in the year 2016 was first evaluated, the assay showed comparable results with conventional PCR-sequencing method where 34 OXA-48 and OXA-232/OXA-181 were detected. By using HRM analysis, the presence of OXA-48-like variants could be easily identified within 3 hours from the pure culture."

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction.

Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans.

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."

Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth.

Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high sterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterol.Aim. In this study, the antifungal activity of statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) against planktonic cells and biofilms of S. schenckii complex species was evaluated, as well as the interaction of pravastatin with classical antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine).Methodology. Eighteen strains of Sporothrix species were used. The antifungal susceptibility assay was performed using the broth microdilution method. Mature biofilms were exposed to statins and metabolic activity was measured by the XTT reduction assay.Results. MICs of statins ranged from 8 to 512 μg ml-1 and from 8 to 256 μg ml-1 for filamentous and yeast forms, respectively. Regarding mature biofilms, MICs of 50 % inhibition (SMIC50) were 128 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and atorvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for pravastatin. MICs of 90 % inhibition (SMIC90) were 512 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for atorvastatin and pravastatin.Conclusion. These results highlight the antifungal and antibiofilm potential of statins against S. schenckii complex species."
32338606,The actin cytoskeletal network plays a role in yeast prion transmission and contributes to prion stability.,20200519,"['Dorweiler Jane E', 'Oddo Mitchell J', 'Lyke Douglas R', 'Reilly Jacob A', 'Wisniewski Brett T', 'Davis Emily E', 'Kuborn Abigail M', 'Merrill Stephen J', 'Manogaran Anita L']","Chaperone networks are required for the shearing and generation of transmissible propagons from pre-existing prion aggregates. However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

This study aimed to determine the chemical and microbiological characteristics of rabbit meat bekasam during the fermentation process in order to isolate, characterize (in vitro and in vivo), and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as the probiotic candidate. The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was the potential probiotic isolate. After being tested on BALB/c mice, L. buchneri could improve the immune system by inhibiting the growth of Coliform and Salmonella."

In this study, different electrode materials, namely, nickel, stainless steel, brass, and graphite were used to investigate the energy production in double chamber microbial fuel cells. Yeast microorganisms (MOs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used at different concentrations for electricity production under different operating conditions with glucose as a substrate. The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

The genes acquired by HGT play important roles in yeast adaptation to the fermentation process, improving nitrogen and carbon source utilization. However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

In this research, a part of hypothetical mechanism on yeast-like cell induction of M. circinelloides in CO2 atmosphere was reported from the viewpoint of gene expression. To explain the relation between the change and the expressions of some genes involved in morphological changes of the strain, these were analyzed on the filamentous and yeast cell by real-time qPCR. The compared genes were Nce103, Ras3, Cyr1, Pde, and Efg1 encoding carbonic anhydrase, GTPase, adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and elongation factor G1, respectively. In anaerobic grown yeast cell with 70%N2 + 30%CO2, the Nce103 and Ras3 gene expressions decreased to 24 h whereas that of the filamentous cell increased. However, a downstream gene of Cyr1 expression level in the yeast cell was higher than that of filamentous cell. A lower level of Pde in the yeast cell than that of the filamentous cell indicated intracellular cAMP accumulation. The actual cAMP in the yeast cell remained whereas that of the filamentous cell decreased with cultivation. The Efg1 expression level controlling hyphal elongation was suppressed in the yeast cell. The intracellular cAMP accumulation and Efg1 expression regulate hyphal elongation or yeast forming."

This study aimed to produce and purify a fungal L-asparaginase through an aqueous two-phase micellar system (ATPMS) using Triton X-114. The fungus Penicillium sp.-encoded 2DSST1 was isolated from Cerrado soil. Plackett-Burman design followed by a 24 full factorial design was used to determine the best conditions to produce L-asparaginase. The evaluated variables were L-asparagine, L-proline, wheat bran, potato dextrose broth, ammonium sulfate, yeast extract, sucrose and glucose concentrations, incubation temperature, incubation period, and initial pH of the culture medium. L-asparaginase quantification was valued by the formation of β-aspartyl hydroxamate. The significant positive variables, L-asparagine, L-proline, potato dextrose broth, and sucrose concentrations, were evaluated at 2 levels (+ 1 and - 1) with triplicate of the central point. After 34 runs, maximum activity (2.33 IU/mL) was achieved at the factorial design central point. A central composite design was performed in ATPMS at two levels (+ 1 and - 1) varying Triton X-114 concentration (w/v), separation phase temperature, and crude extract concentration (w/v).

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays. Consequently, A. resinae KUC3009 can be a promising candidate for scalable production of industrially applicable melanin."
32336374,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential.

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

In a previous study, we constructed a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae capable of producing three STs; 4,8-dihydroxy-22,23-oxidosqualene (ST-1), 8-hydroxy-2,3;22,23-squalene dioxide (ST-2), and 2,3;22,23-squalene dioxide (ST-3). Here, we first evaluated the effects of these STs on the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and found that ST-3 exhibited the greatest potency compared to the other two STs. To further enhance the bioproduction of ST-3, we adopted a tunable system to balance the expression of the Ganoderma lucidum cytochrome P450 gene CYP505D13 in S. cerevisiae, which significantly improved the ST-3 production titer. The most effective strain produced 78.61 mg/L of ST-3 after 62 h fermentation, which was 6.43 times higher than that of our previous study. The present study demonstrated that ST-3 effectively inhibits the proliferation of NSCLC cells, and provides insight into its efficient bioproduction."
32334817,Engineering and optimization of phosphate-responsive phytase expression in Pichia pastoris yeast for phytate hydrolysis.,20200519,"['Xie Zhenming', 'Fong Wing-Ping', 'Tsang Paul Wai-Kei']","Phytate is the major storage form of phosphorus in plants. It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model. These yeast-based whole cell biocatalysts may serve as platform hosts with potential applications in food processing industry and animal waste treatment."

However, some cellular structures are planar and hence 2D imaging should be sufficient, provided that the structure of interest can be oriented with respect to the optical axis of the microscope. Here, we report a 3D microfabrication method which positions and orients cell divisions very close to the microscope coverglass. We use this approach to study cytokinesis in fission yeasts and polarization to lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cells. We show that this method improves spatial resolution on range of common microscopies, including super-resolution STED. Altogether, this method could shed new lights on self-organization phenomena in single cells and 3D cell culture systems."

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."
32334316,Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: A mechanism for dynamic robustness in the yeast cell-cycle process.,20200519,"['Zhao Yao', 'Wang Dedi', 'Zhang Zhiwen', 'Lu Ying', 'Yang Xiaojing', 'Ouyang Qi', 'Tang Chao', 'Li Fangting']","Biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as the cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and maintain dynamic robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

However, the current manufacturing methods for plant natural products mainly rely on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, which are associated with unsustainability and severe environmental problems. The advancement of genetic technology has facilitated the engineering of microbes for producing plant natural products, but their industrial production titers remain low. Yarrowia lipolytica, a nonconventional yeast, is a promising and superior host for plant natural products manufacture, due to its advanced properties compared to conventional hosts. In this review, metabolic engineering approaches recently employed for overproduction of useful plant natural products, including terpenoids and polyketides, in Y. lipolytica are summarized. The current challenges for the biosynthesis of typical compounds are discussed and promising engineering strategies for future work are also suggested. This review provides guidance for engineering Y. lipolytica as a robust host for plant natural products production."

E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications. The described procedure represents a virtuous example of circular economy efficaciously applied for a depleting agri-food resource."

Here, we show that two paralogous transmembrane Rsp5 adaptors, Rcr1 and Rcr2, are sorted to distinct cellular locations: Rcr1 is a plasma membrane (PM) protein, whereas Rcr2 is sorted to the vacuole. Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

The protocol, which is based on in-droplet spheroplasting of the cells, yields an order-of-magnitude higher throughput in comparison to existing methods. After extensive validation of the method, we demonstrate its use by studying the dynamics of the response of isogenic yeast populations to a shift in carbon source, revealing the heterogeneity and underlying molecular processes during this shift.

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

32331647,Plant golgi ultrastructure.,20200518,['Robinson David G'],"The plant Golgi apparatus (sensu lato: Golgi stack + Trans Golgi Network, TGN) is a highly polar and mobile key organelle lying at the junction of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Unlike its counterpart in animal cells it does not disassemble during mitosis. It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Fermentation of cocoa pulp-bean mass is performed mainly in heaps or boxes. It is made possible by a succession of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) activities. Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity.

When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

Improving ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae will increase fermentation efficiency, thereby reducing capital costs. Here, we found that S. cerevisiae strain L exhibited a higher ethanol tolerance (14%, v/v) than the fermentative strain Q (10%, v/v). In order to enhance the strain Q ethanol tolerance but preserve its fermentation property, protoplast fusion was performed with haploids from strain Q and L. The fusant Q/L-f2 with 14% ethanol tolerance was obtained. Meanwhile, the fermentation properties (flocculability, SO2 production, α-N assimilation rate, GSH production, etc.) of Q/L-f2 were similar to those of strain Q. Therefore, our works established a series of high ethanol-tolerant strains in beer production. Moreover, this demonstration of inactivated protoplast fusion in industrial S. cerevisiae strain opens many doors for yeast-based biotechnological applications."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation. Our results suggest that soybean plants coinoculated with these microorganisms might benefit from biocontrol while contributing to soil-nitrogen preservation."

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."
32328754,Isolation and characterization of Salt Overly Sensitive family genes in spinach.,20200517,"['Zhao Chaoyang', 'William David', 'Sandhu Devinder']","The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."
32327780,Pseudouridine-mediated stop codon read-through in S. cerevisiae is sequence context-independent.,20200521,"['Adachi Hironori', 'Yu Yi-Tao']","We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

The impact of the encapsulation of Oenococcus oeni into SiO2-alginate hydrogel (Si-ALG) and the addition of lysozyme in wines inoculated with encapsulated bacteria were also analysed. There was a significant influence of the timing of inoculation on the volatile composition of the wines just as on the amino acid and biogenic amine content. The wines produced by simultaneous AF/MLF showed the highest contents of some volatile compounds, such as ethyl esters and terpenes, as well as amino acids and tyramine. Bacterial encapsulation affected the volatile and amino acid profile of the wines, while the biogenic amine composition was not modified. The chemical composition of the wines was not altered by the presence of lysozyme. A trained panel did not perceive substantial differences between treatments."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

The mammalian Bucentaur/Craniofacial developmental protein 1 (Bcnt/Cfdp1) is also a tentative component of the Srcap (SNF2-Related CBP Activator Protein) chromatin remodeling complex, but little is known about its properties, partly because few antibodies are available to examine the endogenous protein. In this paper, we assigned the western blot signal against the mouse Bcnt/ Cfdp1 as a doublet of approximately 45 kDa using anti-Bcnt/Cfdp1 antibodies, which were generated against either of two unrelated immunogens, BCNT-C domain or mouse N-terminal peptide, and in addition, the Cfdp1 knockdown mouse ES cell line and bovine tissue were used as potential negative controls. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Although they are commensals, under specific conditions they become pathogens, causing skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis in humans, and dermatitis and otitis in dogs. Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta.

Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P

Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is essential and required for the endomembrane system functions in eukaryotic cells. Recently, genes encoding eukaryote-like ESCRT protein components have been identified in the genomes of Asgard archaea, a newly proposed archaeal superphylum that is thought to include the closest extant prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."

Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts. When the assay with isolates collected in the year 2016 was first evaluated, the assay showed comparable results with conventional PCR-sequencing method where 34 OXA-48 and OXA-232/OXA-181 were detected. By using HRM analysis, the presence of OXA-48-like variants could be easily identified within 3 hours from the pure culture."

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

The role mediated by beclin 1 is controlled by various conditions and factors. Beclin 1 is regulated at the gene and protein levels by different factors. These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction.

The best-known organelles and major protein families of this system are largely conserved across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, implying both ancient organization and functional unity. Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans.

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."

Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth.

However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was the potential probiotic isolate.

In this study, different electrode materials, namely, nickel, stainless steel, brass, and graphite were used to investigate the energy production in double chamber microbial fuel cells. Yeast microorganisms (MOs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used at different concentrations for electricity production under different operating conditions with glucose as a substrate. The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

In this research, a part of hypothetical mechanism on yeast-like cell induction of M. circinelloides in CO2 atmosphere was reported from the viewpoint of gene expression. To explain the relation between the change and the expressions of some genes involved in morphological changes of the strain, these were analyzed on the filamentous and yeast cell by real-time qPCR. The compared genes were Nce103, Ras3, Cyr1, Pde, and Efg1 encoding carbonic anhydrase, GTPase, adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and elongation factor G1, respectively. In anaerobic grown yeast cell with 70%N2 + 30%CO2, the Nce103 and Ras3 gene expressions decreased to 24 h whereas that of the filamentous cell increased. However, a downstream gene of Cyr1 expression level in the yeast cell was higher than that of filamentous cell. A lower level of Pde in the yeast cell than that of the filamentous cell indicated intracellular cAMP accumulation. The actual cAMP in the yeast cell remained whereas that of the filamentous cell decreased with cultivation. The Efg1 expression level controlling hyphal elongation was suppressed in the yeast cell. The intracellular cAMP accumulation and Efg1 expression regulate hyphal elongation or yeast forming."

The search for new sources of this enzyme has become attractive for therapeutics. Traditional methods for biomolecule purification involve several steps. A two-phase system may be a good strategy to anticipate one of these stages. This study aimed to produce and purify a fungal L-asparaginase through an aqueous two-phase micellar system (ATPMS) using Triton X-114. The fungus Penicillium sp.-encoded 2DSST1 was isolated from Cerrado soil. Plackett-Burman design followed by a 24 full factorial design was used to determine the best conditions to produce L-asparaginase. The evaluated variables were L-asparagine, L-proline, wheat bran, potato dextrose broth, ammonium sulfate, yeast extract, sucrose and glucose concentrations, incubation temperature, incubation period, and initial pH of the culture medium. L-asparaginase quantification was valued by the formation of β-aspartyl hydroxamate. The significant positive variables, L-asparagine, L-proline, potato dextrose broth, and sucrose concentrations, were evaluated at 2 levels (+ 1 and - 1) with triplicate of the central point. After 34 runs, maximum activity (2.33 IU/mL) was achieved at the factorial design central point. A central composite design was performed in ATPMS at two levels (+ 1 and - 1) varying Triton X-114 concentration (w/v), separation phase temperature, and crude extract concentration (w/v). The L-asparaginase partition coefficient (K) was considered the experimental design response. Out of the 16 systems that were examined, the most promising presented a purification factor of 1.4 and a yield of 100%."

Plackett-Burman method was used to select twelve effective factors including pH, inoculum size, temperature, time, corn starch, KH2PO4, peptone, MgSO4, CaCl2, NaCl, glycerin, and yeast extract concentrations on bacterial alpha-amylases production yield. The Box-Behnken method was utilized to optimize the level of selected significant factors. The stability of bacterial alpha-amylases was also determined in low pH and high-temperature conditions. In addition, in silico study was used to create the alpha-amylase structure and study the stability in high-temperature and low water available condition. Among all isolated and characterized microorganisms, Bacillus megaterium produced the highest amount of alpha-amylases. The in silico data showed the enzyme 3D structure similarity to alpha-amylase from Halothermothrix orenii and highly negative charge amino acids on its surface caused the enzyme activity and stability in low water conditions. Based on Box-Behnken results, the temperature 35 °C, pH 6 and starch 40 g/l were determined as the optimum level of significant factors to achieve the highest alpha-amylases unit (101.44 U/ml). This bacterial alpha-amylases enzyme showed stability at pH 5 and a range of temperatures from 40 to 60 °C that indicates this enzyme may possess the potential for using in industrial processes."

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays. Consequently, A. resinae KUC3009 can be a promising candidate for scalable production of industrially applicable melanin."
32320462,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of VopQ bound to the Vo subcomplex of the V-ATPase. VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model.

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."

Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

32317916,Humanization of yeast genes with multiple human orthologs reveals functional divergence between paralogs.,20200518,"['Laurent Jon M', 'Garge Riddhiman K', 'Teufel Ashley I', 'Wilke Claus O', 'Kachroo Aashiq H', 'Marcotte Edward M']","Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications. The described procedure represents a virtuous example of circular economy efficaciously applied for a depleting agri-food resource."

Here, we show that two paralogous transmembrane Rsp5 adaptors, Rcr1 and Rcr2, are sorted to distinct cellular locations: Rcr1 is a plasma membrane (PM) protein, whereas Rcr2 is sorted to the vacuole. Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

The protocol, which is based on in-droplet spheroplasting of the cells, yields an order-of-magnitude higher throughput in comparison to existing methods. After extensive validation of the method, we demonstrate its use by studying the dynamics of the response of isogenic yeast populations to a shift in carbon source, revealing the heterogeneity and underlying molecular processes during this shift.

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

32317286,Plant golgi ultrastructure.,20200518,['Robinson David G'],"The plant Golgi apparatus (sensu lato: Golgi stack + Trans Golgi Network, TGN) is a highly polar and mobile key organelle lying at the junction of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Unlike its counterpart in animal cells it does not disassemble during mitosis. It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Fermentation of cocoa pulp-bean mass is performed mainly in heaps or boxes. It is made possible by a succession of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) activities. Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to uncover the role of vanillin (Van), a natural food flavoring agent, in inhibiting GC, yeast-to-hyphal transition, and biofilm formation in human fungal pathogen C. albicans."

In this study the inhibition of glucose-induced proton release was determined on the basis of color change of pH indicator, methyl red, from pH 5 to pH6 at cell density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation.

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."

This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."
32309422,Pseudouridine-mediated stop codon read-through in S. cerevisiae is sequence context-independent.,20200521,"['Adachi Hironori', 'Yu Yi-Tao']","We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

In this paper, we assigned the western blot signal against the mouse Bcnt/ Cfdp1 as a doublet of approximately 45 kDa using anti-Bcnt/Cfdp1 antibodies, which were generated against either of two unrelated immunogens, BCNT-C domain or mouse N-terminal peptide, and in addition, the Cfdp1 knockdown mouse ES cell line and bovine tissue were used as potential negative controls. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

The present work showed the functionality of WRKY motifs (TGAC cis-acting elements) present in the promoters of regulatory genes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Pkhmgr) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (Pkdxs) of the picrosides biosynthetic pathway by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta. Collectively, data suggested that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY might be positive and negative regulators, respectively in the picrosides biosynthetic pathway."
32307255,Stress Tolerance of Yeasts Dominating Reverse Osmosis Membranes for Whey Water Treatment.,20200520,"['Vitzilaiou Eirini', 'Aunsbjerg Stina D', 'Mahyudin N A', 'Knøchel Susanne']","Filamentous yeast species belonging to the closely related Saprochaete clavata and Magnusiomyces spicifer were recently found to dominate biofilm communities on the retentate and permeate surface of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes used in a whey water treatment system after CIP (Cleaning-In-Place). Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P 
i
 dynamics, which are assumed to be length- and calcium activity-dependent. Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is essential and required for the endomembrane system functions in eukaryotic cells. Recently, genes encoding eukaryote-like ESCRT protein components have been identified in the genomes of Asgard archaea, a newly proposed archaeal superphylum that is thought to include the closest extant prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."

Upon acute glucose starvation, yeast cells undergo drastic physiological and metabolic changes and reestablish a constant-although lower-level of energy production within minutes. The molecules that are rapidly metabolized to fuel energy production under these conditions are unknown. Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts. When the assay with isolates collected in the year 2016 was first evaluated, the assay showed comparable results with conventional PCR-sequencing method where 34 OXA-48 and OXA-232/OXA-181 were detected. By using HRM analysis, the presence of OXA-48-like variants could be easily identified within 3 hours from the pure culture."

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

The role mediated by beclin 1 is controlled by various conditions and factors. Beclin 1 is regulated at the gene and protein levels by different factors. These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction. This review focuses on the functions of beclin 1, its interacting partners, regulations at gene and protein level, and the role of beclin 1 interactome in relation to various diseases along with the recent developments in the field."

The best-known organelles and major protein families of this system are largely conserved across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, implying both ancient organization and functional unity. Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans. These proteins may well hold clues to understanding differences in cellular function in organisms that are of pressing importance for planetary health."

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."
32302512,Small Molecule Channels Harness Membrane Potential to Concentrate Potassium in trk1Δtrk2Δ Yeast.,20200519,"['Hou Jennifer', 'Daniels Page N', 'Burke Martin D']","Many protein ion channels harness membrane potential to move ions in opposition to their chemical gradient. Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth. This finding expands the list of potential human channelopathies that might be addressed by a molecular prosthetics approach."

Sporotrichosis, caused by species of the Sporothrix schenckii complex, is the most prevalent subcutaneous mycosis in many areas of Latin America. Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high sterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterol.Aim. In this study, the antifungal activity of statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) against planktonic cells and biofilms of S. schenckii complex species was evaluated, as well as the interaction of pravastatin with classical antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine).Methodology. Eighteen strains of Sporothrix species were used. The antifungal susceptibility assay was performed using the broth microdilution method. Mature biofilms were exposed to statins and metabolic activity was measured by the XTT reduction assay.Results. MICs of statins ranged from 8 to 512 μg ml-1 and from 8 to 256 μg ml-1 for filamentous and yeast forms, respectively. Regarding mature biofilms, MICs of 50 % inhibition (SMIC50) were 128 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and atorvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for pravastatin. MICs of 90 % inhibition (SMIC90) were 512 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for atorvastatin and pravastatin.Conclusion. These results highlight the antifungal and antibiofilm potential of statins against S. schenckii complex species."
32302403,The actin cytoskeletal network plays a role in yeast prion transmission and contributes to prion stability.,20200519,"['Dorweiler Jane E', 'Oddo Mitchell J', 'Lyke Douglas R', 'Reilly Jacob A', 'Wisniewski Brett T', 'Davis Emily E', 'Kuborn Abigail M', 'Merrill Stephen J', 'Manogaran Anita L']","Chaperone networks are required for the shearing and generation of transmissible propagons from pre-existing prion aggregates. However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

This study aimed to determine the chemical and microbiological characteristics of rabbit meat bekasam during the fermentation process in order to isolate, characterize (in vitro and in vivo), and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as the probiotic candidate. The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was the potential probiotic isolate.

In this study, different electrode materials, namely, nickel, stainless steel, brass, and graphite were used to investigate the energy production in double chamber microbial fuel cells. Yeast microorganisms (MOs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used at different concentrations for electricity production under different operating conditions with glucose as a substrate. The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

The genes acquired by HGT play important roles in yeast adaptation to the fermentation process, improving nitrogen and carbon source utilization. However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays.

32299824,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of VopQ bound to the Vo subcomplex of the V-ATPase. VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

Here, we first evaluated the effects of these STs on the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and found that ST-3 exhibited the greatest potency compared to the other two STs. To further enhance the bioproduction of ST-3, we adopted a tunable system to balance the expression of the Ganoderma lucidum cytochrome P450 gene CYP505D13 in S. cerevisiae, which significantly improved the ST-3 production titer.

It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model. These yeast-based whole cell biocatalysts may serve as platform hosts with potential applications in food processing industry and animal waste treatment."

Here, we report a 3D microfabrication method which positions and orients cell divisions very close to the microscope coverglass. We use this approach to study cytokinesis in fission yeasts and polarization to lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cells. We show that this method improves spatial resolution on range of common microscopies, including super-resolution STED. Altogether, this method could shed new lights on self-organization phenomena in single cells and 3D cell culture systems."

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."
32297213,Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: A mechanism for dynamic robustness in the yeast cell-cycle process.,20200519,"['Zhao Yao', 'Wang Dedi', 'Zhang Zhiwen', 'Lu Ying', 'Yang Xiaojing', 'Ouyang Qi', 'Tang Chao', 'Li Fangting']","Biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as the cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and maintain dynamic robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

Yarrowia lipolytica, a nonconventional yeast, is a promising and superior host for plant natural products manufacture, due to its advanced properties compared to conventional hosts. In this review, metabolic engineering approaches recently employed for overproduction of useful plant natural products, including terpenoids and polyketides, in Y. lipolytica are summarized. The current challenges for the biosynthesis of typical compounds are discussed and promising engineering strategies for future work are also suggested. This review provides guidance for engineering Y. lipolytica as a robust host for plant natural products production."

E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications. The described procedure represents a virtuous example of circular economy efficaciously applied for a depleting agri-food resource."

Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

32295881,Plant golgi ultrastructure.,20200518,['Robinson David G'],"The plant Golgi apparatus (sensu lato: Golgi stack + Trans Golgi Network, TGN) is a highly polar and mobile key organelle lying at the junction of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Unlike its counterpart in animal cells it does not disassemble during mitosis. It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to uncover the role of vanillin (Van), a natural food flavoring agent, in inhibiting GC, yeast-to-hyphal transition, and biofilm formation in human fungal pathogen C. albicans."

In this study the inhibition of glucose-induced proton release was determined on the basis of color change of pH indicator, methyl red, from pH 5 to pH6 at cell density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

Improving ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae will increase fermentation efficiency, thereby reducing capital costs. Here, we found that S. cerevisiae strain L exhibited a higher ethanol tolerance (14%, v/v) than the fermentative strain Q (10%, v/v). In order to enhance the strain Q ethanol tolerance but preserve its fermentation property, protoplast fusion was performed with haploids from strain Q and L. The fusant Q/L-f2 with 14% ethanol tolerance was obtained. Meanwhile, the fermentation properties (flocculability, SO2 production, α-N assimilation rate, GSH production, etc.) of Q/L-f2 were similar to those of strain Q. Therefore, our works established a series of high ethanol-tolerant strains in beer production. Moreover, this demonstration of inactivated protoplast fusion in industrial S. cerevisiae strain opens many doors for yeast-based biotechnological applications."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation. Our results suggest that soybean plants coinoculated with these microorganisms might benefit from biocontrol while contributing to soil-nitrogen preservation."

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."
32293158,Isolation and characterization of Salt Overly Sensitive family genes in spinach.,20200517,"['Zhao Chaoyang', 'William David', 'Sandhu Devinder']","The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

The mechanism of action of these compounds is associated with the formation of reactive radical species by cleavage of the sesquiterpene pharmacophore endoperoxide bridge. Here we suggested topoisomerase 1 as a possible molecular target for the improvement of the anticancer activity of these compounds. In this context, we report that novel hybrid and dimer derivatives of artesunic acid and artemisinin, bearing camptothecin and SN38 as side-chain biological effectors, can inhibit growth of yeast cells overexpressing human topoisomerase 1 and its enzymatic activity in vitro. These derivatives showed also anticancer activity in melanoma cell lines higher than camptothecin and paclitaxel. In silico molecular docking calculations highlighted a common binding mode for the novel derivatives, with the sesquiterpene lactone scaffold being located near the traditional recognition site for camptothecin, while the bioactive side-chain effector laid in the camptothecin cleft."

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."
32290544,Pseudouridine-mediated stop codon read-through in S. cerevisiae is sequence context-independent.,20200521,"['Adachi Hironori', 'Yu Yi-Tao']","We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

There was a significant influence of the timing of inoculation on the volatile composition of the wines just as on the amino acid and biogenic amine content. The wines produced by simultaneous AF/MLF showed the highest contents of some volatile compounds, such as ethyl esters and terpenes, as well as amino acids and tyramine. Bacterial encapsulation affected the volatile and amino acid profile of the wines, while the biogenic amine composition was not modified. The chemical composition of the wines was not altered by the presence of lysozyme. A trained panel did not perceive substantial differences between treatments."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

The mammalian Bucentaur/Craniofacial developmental protein 1 (Bcnt/Cfdp1) is also a tentative component of the Srcap (SNF2-Related CBP Activator Protein) chromatin remodeling complex, but little is known about its properties, partly because few antibodies are available to examine the endogenous protein. In this paper, we assigned the western blot signal against the mouse Bcnt/ Cfdp1 as a doublet of approximately 45 kDa using anti-Bcnt/Cfdp1 antibodies, which were generated against either of two unrelated immunogens, BCNT-C domain or mouse N-terminal peptide, and in addition, the Cfdp1 knockdown mouse ES cell line and bovine tissue were used as potential negative controls. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Although they are commensals, under specific conditions they become pathogens, causing skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis in humans, and dermatitis and otitis in dogs. Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta.

Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P

Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."
32283651,β-Oxidation and autophagy are critical energy providers during acute glucose depletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,20200520,"['Weber Carmen A', 'Sekar Karthik', 'Tang Jeffrey H', 'Warmer Philipp', 'Sauer Uwe', 'Weis Karsten']","The ability to tolerate and thrive in diverse environments is paramount to all living organisms, and many organisms spend a large part of their lifetime in starvation. Upon acute glucose starvation, yeast cells undergo drastic physiological and metabolic changes and reestablish a constant-although lower-level of energy production within minutes. The molecules that are rapidly metabolized to fuel energy production under these conditions are unknown. Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts. When the assay with isolates collected in the year 2016 was first evaluated, the assay showed comparable results with conventional PCR-sequencing method where 34 OXA-48 and OXA-232/OXA-181 were detected. By using HRM analysis, the presence of OXA-48-like variants could be easily identified within 3 hours from the pure culture."

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

The role mediated by beclin 1 is controlled by various conditions and factors. Beclin 1 is regulated at the gene and protein levels by different factors. These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction. This review focuses on the functions of beclin 1, its interacting partners, regulations at gene and protein level, and the role of beclin 1 interactome in relation to various diseases along with the recent developments in the field."

The best-known organelles and major protein families of this system are largely conserved across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, implying both ancient organization and functional unity. Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans. These proteins may well hold clues to understanding differences in cellular function in organisms that are of pressing importance for planetary health."

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."

Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth.

Sporotrichosis, caused by species of the Sporothrix schenckii complex, is the most prevalent subcutaneous mycosis in many areas of Latin America. Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high sterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterol.Aim. In this study, the antifungal activity of statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) against planktonic cells and biofilms of S. schenckii complex species was evaluated, as well as the interaction of pravastatin with classical antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine).Methodology. Eighteen strains of Sporothrix species were used. The antifungal susceptibility assay was performed using the broth microdilution method. Mature biofilms were exposed to statins and metabolic activity was measured by the XTT reduction assay.Results. MICs of statins ranged from 8 to 512 μg ml-1 and from 8 to 256 μg ml-1 for filamentous and yeast forms, respectively. Regarding mature biofilms, MICs of 50 % inhibition (SMIC50) were 128 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and atorvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for pravastatin. MICs of 90 % inhibition (SMIC90) were 512 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for atorvastatin and pravastatin.Conclusion.

32277834,The actin cytoskeletal network plays a role in yeast prion transmission and contributes to prion stability.,20200519,"['Dorweiler Jane E', 'Oddo Mitchell J', 'Lyke Douglas R', 'Reilly Jacob A', 'Wisniewski Brett T', 'Davis Emily E', 'Kuborn Abigail M', 'Merrill Stephen J', 'Manogaran Anita L']","Chaperone networks are required for the shearing and generation of transmissible propagons from pre-existing prion aggregates. However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was the potential probiotic isolate.

The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

The genes acquired by HGT play important roles in yeast adaptation to the fermentation process, improving nitrogen and carbon source utilization. However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

In this research, a part of hypothetical mechanism on yeast-like cell induction of M. circinelloides in CO2 atmosphere was reported from the viewpoint of gene expression. To explain the relation between the change and the expressions of some genes involved in morphological changes of the strain, these were analyzed on the filamentous and yeast cell by real-time qPCR. The compared genes were Nce103, Ras3, Cyr1, Pde, and Efg1 encoding carbonic anhydrase, GTPase, adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and elongation factor G1, respectively. In anaerobic grown yeast cell with 70%N2 + 30%CO2, the Nce103 and Ras3 gene expressions decreased to 24 h whereas that of the filamentous cell increased. However, a downstream gene of Cyr1 expression level in the yeast cell was higher than that of filamentous cell. A lower level of Pde in the yeast cell than that of the filamentous cell indicated intracellular cAMP accumulation. The actual cAMP in the yeast cell remained whereas that of the filamentous cell decreased with cultivation. The Efg1 expression level controlling hyphal elongation was suppressed in the yeast cell. The intracellular cAMP accumulation and Efg1 expression regulate hyphal elongation or yeast forming."

This study aimed to produce and purify a fungal L-asparaginase through an aqueous two-phase micellar system (ATPMS) using Triton X-114. The fungus Penicillium sp.-encoded 2DSST1 was isolated from Cerrado soil. Plackett-Burman design followed by a 24 full factorial design was used to determine the best conditions to produce L-asparaginase. The evaluated variables were L-asparagine, L-proline, wheat bran, potato dextrose broth, ammonium sulfate, yeast extract, sucrose and glucose concentrations, incubation temperature, incubation period, and initial pH of the culture medium. L-asparaginase quantification was valued by the formation of β-aspartyl hydroxamate. The significant positive variables, L-asparagine, L-proline, potato dextrose broth, and sucrose concentrations, were evaluated at 2 levels (+ 1 and - 1) with triplicate of the central point. After 34 runs, maximum activity (2.33 IU/mL) was achieved at the factorial design central point. A central composite design was performed in ATPMS at two levels (+ 1 and - 1) varying Triton X-114 concentration (w/v), separation phase temperature, and crude extract concentration (w/v).

The Box-Behnken method was utilized to optimize the level of selected significant factors. The stability of bacterial alpha-amylases was also determined in low pH and high-temperature conditions. In addition, in silico study was used to create the alpha-amylase structure and study the stability in high-temperature and low water available condition. Among all isolated and characterized microorganisms, Bacillus megaterium produced the highest amount of alpha-amylases. The in silico data showed the enzyme 3D structure similarity to alpha-amylase from Halothermothrix orenii and highly negative charge amino acids on its surface caused the enzyme activity and stability in low water conditions. Based on Box-Behnken results, the temperature 35 °C, pH 6 and starch 40 g/l were determined as the optimum level of significant factors to achieve the highest alpha-amylases unit (101.44 U/ml).

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays. Consequently, A. resinae KUC3009 can be a promising candidate for scalable production of industrially applicable melanin."
32276418,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model.

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."
32274058,Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: A mechanism for dynamic robustness in the yeast cell-cycle process.,20200519,"['Zhao Yao', 'Wang Dedi', 'Zhang Zhiwen', 'Lu Ying', 'Yang Xiaojing', 'Ouyang Qi', 'Tang Chao', 'Li Fangting']","Biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as the cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and maintain dynamic robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

However, the current manufacturing methods for plant natural products mainly rely on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, which are associated with unsustainability and severe environmental problems. The advancement of genetic technology has facilitated the engineering of microbes for producing plant natural products, but their industrial production titers remain low. Yarrowia lipolytica, a nonconventional yeast, is a promising and superior host for plant natural products manufacture, due to its advanced properties compared to conventional hosts. In this review, metabolic engineering approaches recently employed for overproduction of useful plant natural products, including terpenoids and polyketides, in Y. lipolytica are summarized. The current challenges for the biosynthesis of typical compounds are discussed and promising engineering strategies for future work are also suggested. This review provides guidance for engineering Y. lipolytica as a robust host for plant natural products production."

E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

32272579,Humanization of yeast genes with multiple human orthologs reveals functional divergence between paralogs.,20200518,"['Laurent Jon M', 'Garge Riddhiman K', 'Teufel Ashley I', 'Wilke Claus O', 'Kachroo Aashiq H', 'Marcotte Edward M']","Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications. The described procedure represents a virtuous example of circular economy efficaciously applied for a depleting agri-food resource."

Here, we show that two paralogous transmembrane Rsp5 adaptors, Rcr1 and Rcr2, are sorted to distinct cellular locations: Rcr1 is a plasma membrane (PM) protein, whereas Rcr2 is sorted to the vacuole. Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

The protocol, which is based on in-droplet spheroplasting of the cells, yields an order-of-magnitude higher throughput in comparison to existing methods. After extensive validation of the method, we demonstrate its use by studying the dynamics of the response of isogenic yeast populations to a shift in carbon source, revealing the heterogeneity and underlying molecular processes during this shift.

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

32270227,Plant golgi ultrastructure.,20200518,['Robinson David G'],"The plant Golgi apparatus (sensu lato: Golgi stack + Trans Golgi Network, TGN) is a highly polar and mobile key organelle lying at the junction of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Unlike its counterpart in animal cells it does not disassemble during mitosis. It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

32269702,Overexpression of Populus transcription factor PtrTALE12 increases axillary shoot development by regulating WUSCHEL expression.,20200518,"['Bae So-Young', 'Kim Min-Ha', 'Cho Jin-Seong', 'Park Eung-Jun', 'Lee Hyoshin', 'Kim Jeong-Hoe', 'Ko Jae-Heung']","The TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) transcription factor family has been shown to control meristem formation and organogenesis in plants. To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."

Fermentation of cocoa pulp-bean mass is performed mainly in heaps or boxes. It is made possible by a succession of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) activities. Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to uncover the role of vanillin (Van), a natural food flavoring agent, in inhibiting GC, yeast-to-hyphal transition, and biofilm formation in human fungal pathogen C. albicans."

In this study the inhibition of glucose-induced proton release was determined on the basis of color change of pH indicator, methyl red, from pH 5 to pH6 at cell density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

In order to enhance the strain Q ethanol tolerance but preserve its fermentation property, protoplast fusion was performed with haploids from strain Q and L. The fusant Q/L-f2 with 14% ethanol tolerance was obtained. Meanwhile, the fermentation properties (flocculability, SO2 production, α-N assimilation rate, GSH production, etc.) of Q/L-f2 were similar to those of strain Q. Therefore, our works established a series of high ethanol-tolerant strains in beer production. Moreover, this demonstration of inactivated protoplast fusion in industrial S. cerevisiae strain opens many doors for yeast-based biotechnological applications."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation. Our results suggest that soybean plants coinoculated with these microorganisms might benefit from biocontrol while contributing to soil-nitrogen preservation."

While GIs have been systematically mapped in yeast, there is scarce information about them in humans. Recently, we have suggested a state-of-the-art hierarchical method that leverages gene ontology information for predicting GIs in yeast. Here, we adapt this method and apply it for the first time to predict GIs in human. We introduce a web service called G2G for this task that is available at http://bnet.cs.tau.ac.il/g2g/."
32267207,Simultaneous Nanoscale Imaging of Chemical and Architectural Heterogeneity on Yeast Cell Wall Particles.,20200518,"['Li Wenqian', 'Wang Haomin', 'Xu Xiaoji G', 'Yu Yan']","Particles extracted from the yeast cell walls are naturally occurring immunomodulators with significant therapeutic applications. Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."

This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

FORBI was either directly fermented towards ethanol and hydrogen or was previously subjected to extraction with water resulting to a liquid fraction (extract) rich in sugars and a solid residue, which were then fermented separately. Subsequently, the effluents were assessed as substrates for methane production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Mono-cultures and co-cultures of C5 and C6 yeasts were used for the alcoholic fermentation whereas for the production of hydrogen, mixed acidogenic consortia were used. Taking into account the optimum yields of biofuels, the amount of recoverable energy was estimated based for each different approach. The maximum ethanol yield was 0.16 g ethanol per kg of FORBI and it was achieved for separate fermentation of liquid and solid fractions of the waste. The highest hydrogen yield that was observed was 210.44 L ± 4.02 H2/kg TS FORBI for 1% solids loading and supplementation with cellulolytic enzymes. Direct AD of either the whole FORBI or its individual fractions led to lower overall energy recovery, compared to that obtained when fermentation and subsequent AD were applied. The recoverable energy was estimated for the different exploitation approaches of the waste. The maximum achieved recoverable energy was 21.49 ± 0.57 MJ/kg."

Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."

Therefore, wine yeasts are constantly exposed to these agents. Copper tolerance is related to the copy number of the CUP1 gene, encoding for a metallothionein involved in copper detoxification. In wine yeasts, sulfite resistance mainly depends on the presence of the translocation t(XVI;VIII) in the promoter region of the SSU1 gene. This gene encodes for a plasma membrane sulfite pump involved in sulfite metabolism and detoxification. Recently, a new translocation, t(XVI;VIII), was identified. In this work, 253 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, representing three vineyard populations from two different continents, were analyzed, along with 20 industrial starters. Copper and sulfites tolerance as well as distribution of CUP1 gene copy-number, t(XVI;VIII)and t(XVI;XV) of SSU1 gene were studied to evaluate the impact of these genomic variations on population phenotypes. The CUP1 gene copy-number was found to be highly variable, ranging from zero to 79 per strain. Moreover it differently impacted the copper tolerance in the populations of the two continents. The diffusion of t(XVI;VIII) and, for the first time, t(XVI;XV) was determined in the three vineyard populations. The correlation between the presence of the translocation and strain sulfite tolerance levels was significant only for the t(XVI;VIII)."

Multiple sequence alignments were carried out and computationally refined by applying relative entropy and mutual information thresholds. Through this approach, an ensemble of 20 consensus mutations were identified, 18 of which were consensus/ancestral mutations. The set of consensus variants was produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed individually, while site directed recombination of the best mutations did not produce positive epistasis. The best single variant carried the consensus-ancestral A240G mutation in the neighborhood of the T2/T3 copper cluster, which dramatically improved thermostability, kinetic parameters and secretion."

While there is ample biological understanding and many approved drugs for prototypic GPCRs, most GPCRs still lack well-defined biological ligands and drugs. Here, we report our efforts to tap the potential of understudied GPCRs by developing yeast-based technologies for high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineering and GPCR ligand discovery. We refer to these technologies collectively as Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors, or DCyFIR. A major advantage of DCyFIR is that GPCRs and other assay components are CRISPR-integrated directly into the yeast genome, making it possible to decode ligand specificity by profiling mixtures of GPCR-barcoded yeast strains in a single tube. To demonstrate the capabilities of DCyFIR, we engineered a yeast strain library of 30 human GPCRs and their 300 possible GPCR-Gα coupling combinations. Profiling of these 300 strains, using parallel (DCyFIRscreen) and multiplex (DCyFIRplex) DCyFIR modes, recapitulated known GPCR agonism with 100% accuracy, and identified unexpected interactions for the receptors ADRA2B, HCAR3, MTNR1A, S1PR1, and S1PR2. To demonstrate DCyFIR scalability, we profiled a library of 320 human metabolites and discovered several GPCR-metabolite interactions. Remarkably, many of these findings pertained to understudied pharmacologically dark receptors GPR4, GPR65, GPR68, and HCAR3. Experiments on select receptors in mammalian cells confirmed our yeast-based observations, including our discovery that kynurenic acid activates HCAR3 in addition to GPR35, its known receptor. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the power of DCyFIR for identifying ligand interactions with prototypic and understudied GPCRs."

However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated read-through is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that when a stop codon (pre-mature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of read-through. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated ribosome read-through. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon read-through events."

Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex."

A total of 42 and 41 genes were identified in S. italica and S. viridis, respectively. Further analysis revealed that segmental and tandem duplications have contributed to the expansion of these gene families. RNA-Seq derived expression profiles of the gene family members showed their differential expression pattern in tissues and dehydration stress. Comparative genome mapping and Ks dating provided insights into their duplication and divergence in the course of evolution. Expression profiling of candidate genes in contrasting S. italica cultivars subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments showed distinct stress-specific upregulation of SiαCaH1, SiβCaH5, SiPEPC2, SiPPDK2, SiMDH8, and SiNADP-ME5 in the tolerant cultivar. Overexpression of SiNADP-ME5 in heterologous yeast system enabled the transgenic cells to survive and grow in dehydration stress conditions, which highlights the putative role of SiNADP-ME5 in conferring tolerance to dehydration stress. Altogether, the study highlights key genes that could be potential candidates for elucidating their functional roles in abiotic stress response."

However, its exact function in plant resistance to cold stress is unclear. In the present study, we found that the content of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in akr2a mutants were decreased, and the expression level of KCS1 was also reduced. Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance the VLCFA content and the chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and decrease of VLCFA contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions. These results indicate that AKR2A is involved in chilling tolerance through interaction with KCS1 to affect VLCFA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."

However, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of uncharacterized fission yeast proteins Mso1 and Sec1 in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. Fission yeast Mso1 shares homology with budding yeast Mso1 and human Mint1, proteins that interact with Sec1/Munc18 family proteins during vesicle fusion. Sec1/Munc18 proteins and their interactors are important regulators of SNARE complex formation during vesicle fusion. The roles of these proteins in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis have been barely studied. Here, we show that fission yeast Mso1 is also a Sec1 binding protein and Mso1 and Sec1 localize to the division site interdependently during cytokinesis. The loss of Sec1 localization in mso1Δ cells results in a decrease in vesicle fusion and cytokinesis defects such as slow ring constriction, defective ring disassembly, and delayed plasma membrane closure. We also find that Mso1 and Sec1 may have functions independent of the exocyst tethering complex on the plasma membrane at the division site. Together, Mso1 and Sec1 play essential roles in regulating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery at the division site during cytokinesis.

Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis of the corresponding doublet to the Flag-tagged mouse Bcnt/Cfdp1 that was constitutively expressed in a HEK293 cell exhibited that the upper band was much more phosphorylated than the lower band with preferential Ser phosphorylation in the WESF motif of BCNT-C domain. Western blot analysis with these evaluated antibodies indicated a preferential expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in the early stages of brain development of mouse and rat, which is consistent with a data file of the expression of Bcnt/Cfdp1 mRNA."

In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene."

Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions."

Although they are commensals, under specific conditions they become pathogens, causing skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis in humans, and dermatitis and otitis in dogs. Additionally, these species are associated with fungemia in immunocompromised patients and low-weight neonates in intensive care units with intravenous catheters or with parenteral nutrition and that are under-treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The host-pathogen interaction mechanism in these yeasts is still unclear; for this reason, it is necessary to implement suitable new host systems, such as Galleria mellonella. This infection model has been widely used to assess virulence, host-pathogen interaction, and antimicrobial activity in bacteria and fungi. Some advantages of the G. mellonella model are: (1) the immune response has phagocytic cells and antimicrobial peptides that are similar to those in the innate immune response of human beings; (2) no ethical implications; (3) low cost; and (4) easy to handle and inoculate. This study aims to establish G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for M. furfur and M. pachydermatis. To achieve this objective, first, G. mellonella larvae were first inoculated with different inoculum concentrations of these two Malassezia species, 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 107 CFU/mL, 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, and 11.5 × 109 CFU/mL, and incubated at 33 and 37°C. Then, for 15 days, the mortality and melanization were evaluated daily. Finally, the characterization of hemocytes and fungal burden assessment were as carried out. It was found that at 33 and 37°C both M. furfur and M. pachydermatis successfully established a systemic infection in G. mellonella. M. pachydermatis proved to be slightly more virulent than M. furfur at a temperature of 37°C. The results suggest that larvae mortality and melanization is dependent on the specie of Malassezia, the inoculum concentration and the temperature. According to the findings, G. mellonella can be used as an in vivo model of infection to conduct easy and reliable approaches to boost our knowledge of the Malassezia genus."

The present work showed the functionality of WRKY motifs (TGAC cis-acting elements) present in the promoters of regulatory genes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Pkhmgr) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (Pkdxs) of the picrosides biosynthetic pathway by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Also, the two WRKY genes, PkdWRKY and PksWRKY, were characterized and found to contain double and single characteristic WRKY domains, respectively along with a zinc-finger motif in each domain. Expression analysis revealed that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY exhibited a positive and negative correlation, respectively, with picrosides content under the environment of light and in different tissues. Functional evaluation in yeast showed DNA binding ability of both PksWRKY and PkdWRKY; however, only PkdWRKY exhibited transcriptional activation ability. Transient overexpression of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in tobacco modulated the expression of selected native genes of tobacco involved in MVA and MEP pathway suggesting functionality of PkdWRKY and PksWRKY in planta. Collectively, data suggested that PkdWRKY and PksWRKY might be positive and negative regulators, respectively in the picrosides biosynthetic pathway."
32260418,Stress Tolerance of Yeasts Dominating Reverse Osmosis Membranes for Whey Water Treatment.,20200520,"['Vitzilaiou Eirini', 'Aunsbjerg Stina D', 'Mahyudin N A', 'Knøchel Susanne']","Filamentous yeast species belonging to the closely related Saprochaete clavata and Magnusiomyces spicifer were recently found to dominate biofilm communities on the retentate and permeate surface of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes used in a whey water treatment system after CIP (Cleaning-In-Place). Microscopy revealed that the two filamentous yeast species can cover extensive areas due to their large cell size and long hyphae formation. Representative strains from these species were here further characterized and displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics. Both strains tested were able to grow in twice RO-filtrated permeate water and metabolize the urea present. Little is known about the survival characteristics of these strains. Here, their tolerance toward heat (60, 70, and 80°C) and Ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment at 255 nm using UV-LED was assessed as well as their ability to form biofilm and withstand cleaning associated stress. According to the heat tolerance experiments, the D60°C of S. clavata and M. spicifer is 16.37 min and 7.24 min, respectively, while a reduction of 3.5 to >4.5 log (CFU/mL) was ensured within 5 min at 70°C. UV-C light at a dose level 10 mJ/cm2 had little effect, while doses of 40 mJ/cm2 and upward ensured a ≥4log reduction in a static laboratory scale set-up. The biofilm forming potential of one filamentous yeast and one budding yeast, Sporopachydermia lactativora, both isolated from the same biofilm, was compared in assays employing flat-bottomed polystyrene microwells and peg lids, respectively. In these systems, employing both nutrient rich as well as nutrient poor media, only the filamentous yeast was able to create biofilm. However, on RO membrane coupons in static systems, both the budding yeast and a filamentous yeast were capable of forming single strain biofilms and when these coupons were exposed to different simulations of CIP treatments both the filamentous and budding yeast survived these. The dominance of these yeasts in some filter systems tested, their capacity to adhere and their tolerance toward relevant stresses as demonstrated here, suggest that these slow growing yeasts are well suited to initiate microbial biofouling on surfaces in low nutrient environments."

The azo dye decolorization performance of this strain was characterized, including the degradation pathway and detoxification effects of this yeast. Additionally, the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on this decolorization process was investigated. Activities of key enzymes were analyzed to estimate the change of metabolic activity. Furthermore, possible mechanisms were analyzed through detecting differentially expressed genes between yeast A2 in the absence and presence of SMF. The results indicated that yeast A2 displayed the optimal decolorization performance when the concentrations (in g/L) of glucose, (NH4)2SO4, yeast extract, and NaCl were 4.0, 1.0, 0.1, and ≤30.0, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal rotation speed, temperature, and pH were 160 rpm, 30°C, and 5.0, respectively. Acid Red B was decolorized and detoxified by yeast A2 through successive steps, including cleavage of the naphthalene-amidine bond, reductive deamination, oxidative deamination/desulfurization, open-loop of hydroxy-substituted naphthalene, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The dye decolorization efficiency and halotolerance of yeast A2 were enhanced by 206.3 mT SMF. The activities of manganese peroxidase, and laccase were elevated 1.37- and 1.16-fold by 206.3 mT SMF, but lignin peroxidase activity showed little change. It was suggested from the transcriptome sequence that the enhanced halotolerance might be related to the upregulated genes encoding the enzymes or functional proteins related to intracellular synthesis and accumulation of glycerol."

The energy required for performing these cross-bridge cycles is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P 
i
 ), are then used-among other reactants, such as creatine phosphate-to refuel the ATP energy storage. However, similar to yeasts that perish at the hands of their own waste, the hydrolysis reaction products diminish the chemical potential of ATP and thus inhibit the muscle's force generation as their concentration rises. We suggest to use the term ""exhaustion"" for force reduction (fatigue) that is caused by combined P 
i
 and ADP accumulation along with a possible reduction in ATP concentration. On the basis of bio-chemical kinetics, we present a model of muscle fiber exhaustion based on hydrolytic ATP-ADP-P 
i
 dynamics, which are assumed to be length- and calcium activity-dependent. Written in terms of differential-algebraic equations, the new sub-model allows to enhance existing Hill-type excitation-contraction models in a straightforward way. Measured time courses of force decay during isometric contractions of rabbit M. gastrocnemius and M. plantaris were employed for model verification, with the finding that our suggested model enhancement proved eminently promising. We discuss implications of our model approach for enhancing muscle models in general, as well as a few aspects regarding the significance of phosphate kinetics as one contributor to muscle fatigue."

However, the molecular mechanisms of phosphate (Pi) acquisition in maize plants as well as its redistribution remain unclear. This study presents the functional characterization of ZmPT7 in Pi uptake and redistribution in maize. The ZmPT7 was expressed in roots and leaves, and induced during Pi starvation. The ZmPT7 complemented the Pi-uptake deficiency of yeast mutant phoΔnull and Arabidopsis mutant pht1;1Δ4Δ, indicating that ZmPT7 functioned as a Pi transporter. We generated zmpt7 mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 and ZmPT7-overexpressing lines. The zmpt7 mutants showed reduced, whereas the ZmPT7-overexpressing lines displayed increased Pi uptake capacity and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves, demonstrating that ZmPT7 played central roles in Pi acquisition and Pi redistribution from old to young leaves. The ZmCK2 kinases phosphorylated ZmPT7 at Ser-521 in old maize leaves, which enhanced transport activity of ZmPT7. The Ser-520 of Arabidopsis AtPHT1;1, a conserved residue of ZmPT7 Ser-521, was also phosphorylated by AtCK2 kinase, and the mutation of Ser-520 to Glu (phosphorylation mimic) yielded enhanced transport activity of AtPHT1;1. Taken together, these results indicate that ZmPT7 plays important roles in Pi acquisition and redistribution, and its transport activity is modulated by phosphorylation."

The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies-adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering-to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to utilize D-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast's specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of D-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain's isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass."

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is essential and required for the endomembrane system functions in eukaryotic cells. Recently, genes encoding eukaryote-like ESCRT protein components have been identified in the genomes of Asgard archaea, a newly proposed archaeal superphylum that is thought to include the closest extant prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60, the core functional components of the Asgard ESCRT, coevolved eukaryote-like structural and functional features. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Asgard Vps4, Vps2/24/46, and Vps20/32/60 are closely related to their eukaryotic counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical assays indicate that Asgard Vps4 contains a eukaryote-like microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds the distinct type 1 MIT-interacting motif and type 2 MIT-interacting motif in Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60, respectively. The Asgard Vps4 partly, but much more efficiently than homologs from other archaea, complements the vps4 null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further supporting the functional similarity between the membrane remodeling machineries of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Thus, this work provides evidence that the ESCRT complexes from Asgard archaea and eukaryotes are evolutionarily related and functionally similar. Thus, despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in Asgard archaea, the eukaryotic ESCRT seems to have been directly inherited from an Asgard ancestor, to become a key component of the emerging endomembrane system.IMPORTANCE The discovery of Asgard archaea has changed the existing ideas on the origins of eukaryotes. Researchers propose that eukaryotic cells evolved from Asgard archaea. This hypothesis partly stems from the presence of multiple eukaryotic signature proteins in Asgard archaea, including homologs of ESCRT proteins that are essential components of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. However, structural and functional features of Asgard ESCRT remain unknown. Our study provides evidence that Asgard ESCRT is functionally comparable to the eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that despite the apparent absence of endomembranes in archaea, eukaryotic ESCRT was inherited from an Asgard archaeal ancestor, alongside the emergence of endomembrane system during eukaryogenesis."

It has been proposed that in addition to these functions, elevated levels of polyamines promote longevity in various biological systems, including yeast, drosophila, and murine models. A series of in vitro mechanistic studies by multiple investigators has led to the conclusion that addition of exogenous spermidine promotes longevity through autophagy induction; however, these experiments were confounded by the use of mammalian cell culture systems supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Using cell viability assays, LC3B immunoblots, and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report here that in the presence of ruminant serum, exogenously added polyamines are quickly oxidized by the copper-containing bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO). This polyamine oxidation resulted in the production of harmful byproducts including hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and reactive aldehydes. Our data demonstrate that it is critically important to prevent confounding BSAO-induced cytotoxicity in mechanistic studies of the roles of polyamines in autophagy."

Upon acute glucose starvation, yeast cells undergo drastic physiological and metabolic changes and reestablish a constant-although lower-level of energy production within minutes. The molecules that are rapidly metabolized to fuel energy production under these conditions are unknown. Here, we combine metabolomics and genetics to characterize the cells' response to acute glucose depletion and identify pathways that ensure survival during starvation. We show that the ability to respire is essential for maintaining the energy status and to ensure viability during starvation. Measuring the cells' immediate metabolic response, we find that central metabolites drastically deplete and that the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio strongly increases within 20 to 30 s. Furthermore, we detect changes in both amino acid and lipid metabolite levels. Consistent with this, both bulk autophagy, a process that frees amino acids, and lipid degradation via β-oxidation contribute in parallel to energy maintenance upon acute starvation. In addition, both these pathways ensure long-term survival during starvation. Thus, our results identify bulk autophagy and β-oxidation as important energy providers during acute glucose starvation."

Using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed how the cellular memory of stress adaptation is encoded in single yeast cells. We found that cellular memory was biphasic. Short-lived memory was mediated by trehalose synthase and trehalose metabolism. Long-lived memory was mediated by PKA-regulated stress-responsive transcription factors and cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules. Short- and long-lived memory could be selectively induced by different priming input dynamics. Computational modeling revealed how the PKA-mediated regulatory network could encode previous stimuli into memories with distinct dynamics. This biphasic memory-encoding scheme might represent a general strategy to prepare for future challenges in rapidly changing environments."

After unrelated, previous surgery and antibiotic treatment, a saddle horse showed well-circumscribed areas of non-pruritic alopecia. Suspecting allergic skin disease, the horse was treated with corticosteroids. The skin lesion spread, and a second veterinarian was consulted. At clinical examination, the horse was lethargic, pyretic and hair was shedding/easily epilated over the head, neck, shoulders, and legs and the hind legs were swollen. Blood analysis revealed mild leucocytosis and hyperglobulinemia. Hair, skin scraping, and skin biopsy ruled out parasites and bacteria; cytology identified yeast-like structures with hyphae or pseudohyphae. Geotrichum candidum was isolated on culture. Treatment consisted of stable disinfection, topical application of an antifungal solution, vitamins C and E supplementation and allowing the horse to graze in sunlight for at least 6 h/day. At 3-weeks follow-up, the horse had gained weight, alopecia was decreased, and all other clinical parameters were normal. Antifungal treatment was continued twice a week for three months. This study suggests Geotrichum candidum may cause skin lesions in horses after long-term use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. To avoid unnecessary and prolonged suffering in cases of dermatitis, veterinarians should be promptly consulted, appropriate diagnostic procedures conducted, so that a definitive diagnosis can be reached, and an appropriate treatment regimen implemented."

The SEM and XRD analysis suggested that here used MW-CNTs are in the range of 10-25 nm in diameter and their structure was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae cells, affected by MW-CNTs, by cell count, culture optical density and atomic force microscopy. The yeast cells were exposed towards MW-CNTs (of 2, 50, 100 μg/mL concentrations in water-based solution) for 24 h. A mathematical model was applied for the evaluation of relative growth and relative death rates of yeast cells. We calculated that both of the rates are two times higher in the case if yeasts were treated by 50, 100 μg/mL of MW-CNTs containing solution, comparing to that treated by 0 and 2 μg/mL c of MW-CNTs containing solution. It was determined that the MW-CNTs have some observable effect upon the incubation of the yeast cells. The viability of yeast has decreased together with MW-CNTs concentration only after 5 h of the treatment. Therefore, we predict that the MW-CNTs can be applied for the modification of yeast cells in order to improve electrical charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and/or the cell wall."

The separate addition of carnosic acid and propolis on exponential cultures of the standard SC5314 C. albicans strain caused a moderate degree of cell death at relatively high concentrations. However, the combination of both extracts, especially in a 1:4 ratio, induced a potent synergistic pattern, leading to a drastic reduction in cell survival even at much lower concentrations. The result of a mathematical analysis by isobologram was consistent with synergistic action of the combined extracts rather than a merely additive effect. In turn, the capacity of SC5314 cells to form in vitro biofilms was also impaired by the simultaneous presence of both agents, supporting the potential application of carnosic acid and propolis mixtures in the prevention and treatment of clinical infections as an alternative to antibiotics and other antifungal agents endowed with reduced toxic side effects."

However, the TP catalytic cycle is complex, depending on multiple redox reactions and partners, and is subjected to branching and competition points that may limit their peroxide reductase activity in vivo. The goals of the present study were to demonstrate peroxynitrite reductase activity of TP members in live cells in real time and to evaluate its catalytic characteristics. To these ends, we developed a simple fluorescence assay using coumarin boronic acid (CBA), exploiting that fact that TP and CBA compete for peroxynitrite, with the expectation that higher TP peroxynitrite reductase activity will lower the CBA oxidation. TP peroxynitrite reductase activity was evaluated by comparing CBA oxidation in live wild type and genetically modified Δ8 (TP-deficient strain) and Δ8+TSA1 (Δ8 strain that expresses only one TP member, the TSA1 gene) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The results showed that CBA oxidation decreased with cell density and increased with increasing peroxynitrite availability. Additionally, the rate of CBA oxidation decreased in the order Δ8 > Δ8+TSA1 > WT strains both in control and glycerol-adapted (expressing higher TP levels) cells, showing that the CBA competition assay could reliably detect peroxynitrite in real time in live cells, comparing CBA oxidation in strains with reduced and increased TP expression. Finally, there were no signs of compromised TP peroxynitrite reductase activity during experimental runs, even at the highest peroxynitrite levels tested. Altogether, the results show that TP is a major component in the defense of yeast against peroxynitrite insults under basal and increasing stressful conditions."

Rapid detection and differentiation of OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes are critical for targeted treatment and infection control. In this study, we aimed to develop high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the differentiation of OXA-48 variants. HRM analysis is a post-polymerase chain reaction (post-PCR) method for identification of small variations in nucleic acid sequences based on the PCR dissociation curve. A total of 82 bacterial strains, which consisted of Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae, were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined, and the developed assay was evaluated using the collected isolates against conventional-sequencing method. Overall, the developed assay was able to detect isolates that harboured OXA-48 and OXA232/OXA-181 by showing two distinct peaks at 81.1 ± 0.2 °C and 82.1 ± 0.2 °C, respectively. The detection limit of the assay was 1.6 x 10-6 ng/µl for OXA-48 and 1.8 x 10-7 ng/µl for OXA-232/OXA-181. This assay showed 100% specificity when evaluated on a panel of 37 isolates comprised of different species of bacteria and yeasts.

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a promising and efficient investigation technique for the development of novel lab-on-a-chip devices, which characterizes cells or particles based on their intrinsic and physical properties. Using this method, specific cells can be isolated from their medium carrier or the mixture of cell suspensions (e.g., separation of viable cells from non-viable cells). Main advantages of this method, which makes it favorable for disease (blood) analysis and diagnostic applications are, the preservation of the cell properties during measurements, label-free cell identification, and low set up cost. In this study, we validated the capability of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated microfluidic devices for the manipulation and characterization of live and dead yeast cells using dielectrophoretic forces. This approach successfully trapped live yeast cells and purified them from dead cells. Numerical simulations based on a two-layer model for yeast cells flowing in the channel were used to predict the trajectories of the cells with respect to their dielectric properties, varying excitation voltage, and frequency."

The current concern about the potential negative effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on consumer health has focused the interest on replacing or reducing SO2 use. Our work aims to develop a strategy based on the use of selected starter culture, able to perform wine fermentation without SO2 addition. Four selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae indigenous strains were tested as mixed starter cultures in laboratory scale fermentations. The starter culture, characterized by a similar percentage of dominance of both strains composing the mixed starter and able to produce a wine characterized by the best combination of chemical and aromatic characteristics, was chosen. This mixed culture was tested as a starter at pilot scale with and without SO2 addition, by using a higher inoculum level in the vinification without SO2. The selected starter confirmed higher dominance ability in vinification without SO2 addition than in SO2-added fermentation, demonstrating that sulfite addition is not a guarantee to reach an absolute dominance of starter culture on indigenous microflora. The proposed biotechnological tool allowed to produce good quality wines possessing also ""functional properties"", as NO-SO2 added wines were characterized by high polyphenol content and antioxidant activity."

The function of beclin 1 depends on the interaction with several autophagy-related genes (Atgs) and other proteins during the autophagy process. The role mediated by beclin 1 is controlled by various conditions and factors. Beclin 1 is regulated at the gene and protein levels by different factors. These regulations could subsequently alter the beclin 1 induced autophagy process. Therefore, it is important to study the components of beclin 1 interactome and factors affecting its expression. Expression of this gene is differentially regulated under different conditions in different cells or tissues. So, the regulation part is important to study as beclin 1 is one of the candidate genes involved in diseases related to autophagy dysfunction. This review focuses on the functions of beclin 1, its interacting partners, regulations at gene and protein level, and the role of beclin 1 interactome in relation to various diseases along with the recent developments in the field."

The best-known organelles and major protein families of this system are largely conserved across the vast diversity of eukaryotes, implying both ancient organization and functional unity. Nonetheless, intriguing variation exists that speaks to the evolutionary forces that have shaped the endomembrane system in eukaryotes and highlights ways in which membrane trafficking in protists differs from that in our well-understood models of mammalian and yeast cells. Both parasites and free-living protists possess specialized trafficking organelles, some lineage specific, others more widely distributed - the evolution and function of these organelles begs exploration. Novel members of protein families are present across eukaryotes but have been lost in humans. These proteins may well hold clues to understanding differences in cellular function in organisms that are of pressing importance for planetary health."

However, reports on Hsp70 genes are scarce in microsporidia, a very large group of obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all animals, including humans. In this study, we identified 37 Hsp70 proteins from eight microsporidian genomes and classified them into four subfamilies (A-D). The number of Hsp70 genes in these microsporidia was significantly fewer than in Rozella allomycis and yeast. All microsporidian species contained genes from each subfamily and similar subcellular locations (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and cytosol and/or nucleus), indicating that each Hsp70 member may fulfil distinct functions. The conserved structures and motifs of the Hsp70 proteins in the same subfamily were highly similar. Expression analysis indicated that the subfamily C cytosol (cyto)-associated Hsp70s is functional during microsporidia development. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that Cyto-NbHsp70 was cytoplasmically located in the proliferation-stage of Nosema bombycis. Cyto-NbHsp70 antiserum also labeled Encephalitozoon hellem within infected cells, suggesting that this antiserum is a potential molecular marker for labeling the proliferative phases of different microsporidian species. The propagation of N. bombycis was significantly inhibited following RNAi of Cyto-NbHsp70, indicating that Cyto-NbHsp70 is important for pathogen proliferation. Our phylogenetic data suggest that Hsp70 proteins evolved during microsporidia adaption to intracellular parasitism, and they play important roles in pathogen development."

Domain-swapped dimer (DSD) conformations of cytc have been reported both by our laboratory and others. The DSD is an alternate conformer of cytc that could oxygenate CL early in apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the cytc DSD has a set of properties that would provide tighter regulation of the intrinsic pathway. We show that the human DSD is kinetically more stable than horse and yeast DSDs. Circular dichroism data indicate that the DSD has a less asymmetric heme environment, similar to that seen when the monomeric protein binds to CL vesicles at high lipid-to-protein ratios. The dimer undergoes the alkaline conformational transition near pH 7.0, 2.5 pH units lower than that of the monomer. Data from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence anisotropy suggest that the alkaline transition of the DSD may act as a switch from high affinity for CL nanodiscs at pH 7.4 to much lower affinity at pH 8.0. Additionally, the peroxidase activity of the human DSD increases seven-fold compared to the monomer at pH 7 and 8, but by 14-fold at pH 6 when mixed Met80/H2O ligation replaces the lysine ligation of the alkaline state. We also present data that indicate that cytc binding shows a cooperative effect as the concentration of cytc is increased. The DSD appears to have evolved into a pH-inducible switch that provides a means to control activation of apoptosis near pH 7.0."

While earlier studies elucidated basic mechanisms therein, recent advances in high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy enabled to investigate proton-transfer coupled FO rotary dynamics at structural details. Here, taking a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulation method, we studied reversible dynamics of a yeast mitochondrial FO. We obtained the 36°-stepwise rotations of FO per one proton transfer in the ATP synthesis mode and the proton pumping in the ATP hydrolysis mode. In both modes, the most prominent path alternatively sampled states with two and three deprotonated glutamates in c-ring, by which the c-ring rotates one step. The free energy transduction efficiency in the model FO motor reached ~ 90% in optimal conditions. Moreover, mutations in key glutamate and a highly conserved arginine increased proton leakage and markedly decreased the coupling, in harmony with previous experiments. This study provides a simple framework of simulations for chemical-reaction coupled molecular dynamics calling for further studies in ATP synthase and others."

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMDD1, we found that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 required its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules was protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffused rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70's diffusion in LGMDD1 mouse muscle was diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMDD1 mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilized HSP70, improved strength and corrected myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy."
32255230,Small Molecule Channels Harness Membrane Potential to Concentrate Potassium in trk1Δtrk2Δ Yeast.,20200519,"['Hou Jennifer', 'Daniels Page N', 'Burke Martin D']","Many protein ion channels harness membrane potential to move ions in opposition to their chemical gradient. Deficiencies of such proteins cause several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Bartter Syndrome, and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Using yeast as a eukaryotic model system, we asked whether, in the context of a protein ion channel deficiency in vivo, small molecule channels could similarly harness membrane potential to concentrate ions. Trk potassium transporters use membrane potential to move potassium from a relatively low concentration outside cells (~15mM) to one of >10X higher inside (150-500mM); trk1Δtrk2Δ are unable to concentrate potassium or grow in standard media. Here we show that potassium permeable, but not potassium selective, small molecule ion channels formed by amphotericin B can harness membrane potential to concentrate potassium and thereby restore trk1Δtrk2Δ growth. This finding expands the list of potential human channelopathies that might be addressed by a molecular prosthetics approach."

Sporotrichosis, caused by species of the Sporothrix schenckii complex, is the most prevalent subcutaneous mycosis in many areas of Latin America. Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high sterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterol.Aim. In this study, the antifungal activity of statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) against planktonic cells and biofilms of S. schenckii complex species was evaluated, as well as the interaction of pravastatin with classical antifungals (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine).Methodology. Eighteen strains of Sporothrix species were used. The antifungal susceptibility assay was performed using the broth microdilution method. Mature biofilms were exposed to statins and metabolic activity was measured by the XTT reduction assay.Results. MICs of statins ranged from 8 to 512 μg ml-1 and from 8 to 256 μg ml-1 for filamentous and yeast forms, respectively. Regarding mature biofilms, MICs of 50 % inhibition (SMIC50) were 128 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and atorvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for pravastatin. MICs of 90 % inhibition (SMIC90) were 512 μg ml-1 for simvastatin and >2048 μg ml-1 for atorvastatin and pravastatin.Conclusion. These results highlight the antifungal and antibiofilm potential of statins against S. schenckii complex species."
32253629,The actin cytoskeletal network plays a role in yeast prion transmission and contributes to prion stability.,20200519,"['Dorweiler Jane E', 'Oddo Mitchell J', 'Lyke Douglas R', 'Reilly Jacob A', 'Wisniewski Brett T', 'Davis Emily E', 'Kuborn Abigail M', 'Merrill Stephen J', 'Manogaran Anita L']","Chaperone networks are required for the shearing and generation of transmissible propagons from pre-existing prion aggregates. However, other cellular networks needed for maintaining yeast prions are largely uncharacterized. Here, we establish a novel role for actin networks in prion maintenance. The [PIN+ ] prion, also known as [RNQ+ ], exists as stable variants dependent upon the chaperone machinery for the transmission of propagons to daughter cells during cell division and cytoplasmic transfer. Loss of the Hsp104 molecular chaperone leads to the growth of prion particles until they are too large to be transmitted. Here, we isolated a unique [PIN+ ] variant, which is unstable in actin mutants. This prion loss is observed over many generations, and coincides with the detection of both high molecular weight species of Rnq1 and large visible aggregates that are asymmetrically retained during cell division. Our data suggest that the irregular actin networks found in these mutants may influence propagon number by slowly permitting aggregate growth over time, resulting in the generation of non-transmissible large aggregates. Thus, we show the potential contribution of cytoskeletal networks in the transmission of prion propagons, which parallels models that have been proposed for cell-to-cell transmission of small amyloids in neurodegenerative protein aggregation diseases."

This study aimed to determine the chemical and microbiological characteristics of rabbit meat bekasam during the fermentation process in order to isolate, characterize (in vitro and in vivo), and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as the probiotic candidate. The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria (2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast (9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was the potential probiotic isolate.

In this study, different electrode materials, namely, nickel, stainless steel, brass, and graphite were used to investigate the energy production in double chamber microbial fuel cells. Yeast microorganisms (MOs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used at different concentrations for electricity production under different operating conditions with glucose as a substrate. The produced current and potential of the electrode were measured for ranges of operating conditions such as MO concentration (1-8 g/L), flow velocity (0-600 rpm), and aeration of the catholyte. It was found that there was a different performance exhibited by each electrode material, with nickel and graphite giving the highest efficiency. Increasing the flow velocity and aeration in the cathode compartment led to increasing the produced current while the flow and aeration in the anode compartment had a negative effect on the produced current. Simultaneous aeration and agitation gave high produced current values, while high agitation with aeration reduced the efficacy. The increased concentration of substrate glucose showed different influences on the produced current depending on electrode materials."

However, it is unknown whether plant viruses may use this mechanism in their pathogenesis. Here, we report that the 17K protein, encoded by barley yellow dwarf viruses and related poleroviruses, delays G2/M transition and disrupts mitosis in both host (barley) and nonhost (fission yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco) cells through interrupting the function of Wee1-Cdc25-CDKA/Cdc2 via direct protein-protein interactions and alteration of CDKA/Cdc2 phosphorylation. When ectopically expressed, 17K disrupts the mitosis of cultured human cells, and HIV-1 Vpr inhibits plant cell growth. Furthermore, 17K and Vpr share similar secondary structural feature and common amino acid residues required for interacting with plant CDKA. Thus, our work reveals a distinct class of mitosis regulators that are conserved between plant and animal viruses and play active roles in viral pathogenesis."

The genes acquired by HGT play important roles in yeast adaptation to the fermentation process, improving nitrogen and carbon source utilization. However, the functional characterization of these genes at the molecular level has been poorly attended. In this work, we carried out a systematic analysis of the promoter activity and protein level of 30 genes contained in three horizontally acquired regions commonly known as regions A, B, and C. In three strains (one for each region), we used the luciferase reporter gene and the mCherry fluorescent protein to quantify the transcriptional and translational activity of these genes, respectively. We assayed the strains generated in four different culture conditions; all showed low levels of transcriptional and translational activity across these environments. However, we observed an increase in protein levels under low nitrogen culture conditions, suggesting a possible role of the horizontally acquired genes in the adaptation to nitrogen-limited environments. Furthermore, since the strains carrying the luciferase reporter gene are null mutants for the horizontally acquired genes, we assayed growth parameters (latency time, growth rate, and efficiency) and the fermentation kinetics in this set of deletion strains. The results showed that single deletion of 20 horizontally acquired genes modified the growth parameters, whereas the deletion of five of them altered the maximal CO2 production rate (Vmax). Interestingly, we observed a correlation between growth parameters and Vmax for an ORF within region A, encoding an ortholog to a thiamine (vitamin B1) transporter whose deletion decreased the growth rate, growth efficiency, and CO2 production. Altogether, our results provided molecular and phenotypic evidence highlighting the importance of horizontally acquired genes in yeast adaptation to fermentative environments."

However, the conventional sources (e.g. mushroom, hair, and wool) of melanin production entail pigments inside the substrates which requires the costly extraction procedures, leading to inappropriate scalable production. In this study, we screened 102 of fungal isolates for their ability to produce melanin in the supernatant and selected the only Amorphotheca resinae as a promising candidate. In the peptone yeast extract glucose broth, A. resinae produced the melanin rapidly during the autolysis phase of growth, reaching up 4.5 g/L within 14 days. Structural characterization of the purified melanin from A. resinae was carried out by using elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in comparison with the standard melanins. The results indicate that the structural properties of A. resinae melanin is similar to the eumelanin which has a wide range of industrial uses. For example, the purified melanin from A. resinae has the potent antioxidant activities as a result of free radical scavenging assays. Consequently, A. resinae KUC3009 can be a promising candidate for scalable production of industrially applicable melanin."
32252198,Dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle.,20200519,['Tourigny David S'],"Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to cope with the unpredictability of environmental conditions, and yet mainstream models of metabolic regulation are typically based on strict optimality principles that do not account for uncertainty. This paper introduces a dynamic metabolic modelling framework that is a synthesis of recent ideas on resource allocation and the powerful optimal control formulation of Ramkrishna and colleagues. In particular, their work is extended based on the hypothesis that cellular resources are allocated among elementary flux modes according to the principle of maximum entropy. These concepts both generalise and unify prior approaches to dynamic metabolic modelling by establishing a smooth interpolation between dynamic flux balance analysis and dynamic metabolic models without regulation. The resulting theory is successful in describing 'bet-hedging' strategies employed by cell populations dealing with uncertainty in a fluctuating environment, including heterogenous resource investment, accumulation of reserves in growth-limiting conditions, and the observed behaviour of yeast growing in batch and continuous cultures. The maximum entropy principle is also shown to yield an optimal control law consistent with partitioning resources between elementary flux mode families, which has important practical implications for model reduction, selection, and simulation."

Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli bacteria and a yeast Candida albicans, grown on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V alloy used in the manufacture of prosthetic implants, were employed. Their biofilms were exposed to NTP produced by DC cometary discharge and subsequently treated with antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of infections caused by them: erythromycin (ERY), polymyxin B (PMB), or amphotericin B (AMB), respectively. All biofilms displayed significant reduction of their metabolic activity after NTP exposure, the most sensitive was S. epidermidis. The subsequent action of antibiotics caused significant decrease in the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli, but not C. albicans, although the area covered by biofilm decreased in all cases. The combined effect of NTP with antibiotics was thus proved to be a promising strategy in bacterial pathogen treatment."

Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone under strict regulation by various transcription factors (TFs) that acts as a signaling compound in the regulation of plant defense responses and development. Here, we report that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type TF, OsbHLH034, plays an important role in the JA-mediated resistance response against rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The expression of OsbHLH034 was upregulated at a late phase after JA treatment. OsbHLH034 interacted with a Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein, OsJAZ9, in both plant and yeast cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH034 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased resistance against rice bacterial blight. Conversely, OsbHLH034-overexpressing plants exhibited high sensitivity to salt stress. The expression of some JA-responsive secretory-type peroxidase genes was upregulated in the OsbHLH034-overexpressing rice plants. Concomitantly, the lignin content significantly increased in these transgenic plants compared to that in the wild-type. These results indicate that OsbHLH034 acts as a positive regulator of the JA-mediated defense response in rice."

The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic, machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, in the presence of uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes and identify false alarms and miss events associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curves conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision-making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision-making approach can be extended to more than two possible outcomes. As an example and to show how the introduced methods can be used in practice, we apply them to single cell data of PTEN, an important intracellular regulatory molecule in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from viruses, bacteria, yeast and lower metazoans to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be utilized to better understand the transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases."

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of VopQ bound to the Vo subcomplex of the V-ATPase. VopQ inserts into membranes and forms an unconventional pore while binding directly to subunit c of the V-ATPase membrane-embedded subcomplex Vo. We show that VopQ arrests yeast growth in vivo by targeting the immature Vo subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus providing insight into the observation that VopQ kills cells in the absence of a functional V-ATPase. VopQ is a bacterial effector that has been discovered to inhibit a host-membrane megadalton complex by coincidentally binding its target, inserting into a membrane and disrupting membrane potential. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism by which bacterial effectors modulate host cell biology and provide an invaluable tool for future studies on V-ATPase-mediated membrane fusion and autophagy."

However, in the absence of damage, centromere locations are usually conserved within a species. We report here that isolates of the pathogenic yeast species Candida parapsilosis show within-species polymorphism for the location of centromeres on two of its eight chromosomes. Its old centromeres have an inverted-repeat (IR) structure, whereas its new centromeres have no obvious structural features but are located within 30 kb of the old site. Centromeres can therefore move naturally from one chromosomal site to another, apparently spontaneously and in the absence of any significant changes in DNA sequence. Our observations are consistent with a model in which all centromeres are genetically determined, such as by the presence of short or long IRs or by the ability to form cruciforms. We also find that centromeres have been hotspots for genomic rearrangements in the C. parapsilosis clade."

It is activated by a MAPK binding-protein, Ssp2, upon completion of the meiotic divisions. The activation of Smk1 by Ssp2 is positively regulated by a meiosis-specific co-activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ama1. Here, we identify Isc10 as an inhibitor that links APC/CAma1 to Smk1 activation. Isc10 and Smk1 form an inhibited complex during MI. Ssp2 is produced later in the program and it forms a ternary complex with Isc10 and Smk1 during MII that is poised for activation. Upon completion of MII, Isc10 is ubiquitylated and degraded in an AMA1-dependent manner, thereby triggering the activation of Smk1 by Ssp2. Mutations that cause Ssp2 to be produced before MII, or isc10Δ, modestly reduced the efficiency of spore differentiation while spores were nearly absent in the double mutant. These findings define a pathway that couples spore differentiation to the G0-like phase of the cell-cycle."

Here, we first evaluated the effects of these STs on the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and found that ST-3 exhibited the greatest potency compared to the other two STs. To further enhance the bioproduction of ST-3, we adopted a tunable system to balance the expression of the Ganoderma lucidum cytochrome P450 gene CYP505D13 in S. cerevisiae, which significantly improved the ST-3 production titer. The most effective strain produced 78.61 mg/L of ST-3 after 62 h fermentation, which was 6.43 times higher than that of our previous study.

It is present in cereals and raw materials of vegetable origin used in animal and human diets. However, non-ruminant animals have little phytase activity in their guts and, therefore, cannot digest phytate. As a result, almost all dietary phytate is discharged into the environment, causing phosphorus pollution. Phytate is also considered as an ""antinutrient"" for its ability to form insoluble and stable complexes with metal ions, thus reducing dietary absorption of essential minerals. It is a dire need to develop sustainable approaches for environmentally-friendly utilization for this valuable and abundant natural resource. To this end, we engineered Pichia pastoris to express and secrete phytase in a ""made-to-order"" fashion in response to external level of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Responsiveness to external Pi level was achieved by generating a Pi-responsive promoter library using directed evolution. The resultant yeast strains were proven to liberate Pi from wheat-based meal in a simulated in vitro digestion model. These yeast-based whole cell biocatalysts may serve as platform hosts with potential applications in food processing industry and animal waste treatment."

However, some cellular structures are planar and hence 2D imaging should be sufficient, provided that the structure of interest can be oriented with respect to the optical axis of the microscope. Here, we report a 3D microfabrication method which positions and orients cell divisions very close to the microscope coverglass. We use this approach to study cytokinesis in fission yeasts and polarization to lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cells. We show that this method improves spatial resolution on range of common microscopies, including super-resolution STED. Altogether, this method could shed new lights on self-organization phenomena in single cells and 3D cell culture systems."

In this study, 448 male ROSS 308 chicks were divided into subgroups: a control group (I) fed on soybean meal (SBM), and six experimental groups II-rapeseed meal (RSM); III-white lupin (WY); IV-yellow lupin (YL); V-narrow-leaved lupin NLL; VI-pea (Pe); and VII-faba bean (FB). After 42 days of rearing, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered and dissected. The control group was characterized by better growth performance compared to the other groups. In addition, the European Broiler Index was lower in each experimental group compared to the SBM group. A lower dressing percentage was found only in the NLL group. The muscle content in birds from the RSM and FB groups was significantly higher than in the other groups, but the fat content was lower. Meat from SBM group was characterized by the highest protein content, but a reduced content of fat and water in the muscles. The most similar results were found between the control group and the FB group receiving a diet based on faba beans. Furthermore, lupins had a similar effect on the carcass traits when used in the diets. The quality of meat in broilers fed on faba beans with the addition of potato protein and brewers' yeast was similar to that of those fed on soybean meal, because the antinutrients were the lowest in faba bean seeds. Faba beans are proposed as a possible alternative source of protein in poultry diets. Other legume seeds should be analyzed in future studies."
32251304,Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: A mechanism for dynamic robustness in the yeast cell-cycle process.,20200519,"['Zhao Yao', 'Wang Dedi', 'Zhang Zhiwen', 'Lu Ying', 'Yang Xiaojing', 'Ouyang Qi', 'Tang Chao', 'Li Fangting']","Biological processes that execute complex multiple functions, such as the cell cycle, must ensure the order of sequential events and maintain dynamic robustness against various fluctuations. Here, we examine the mechanisms and fundamental structure that achieve these properties in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that this process behaves like an excitable system containing three well-decoupled saddle-node bifurcations to execute DNA replication and mitosis events. The yeast cell-cycle regulatory network can be divided into three modules-the G1/S phase, early M phase, and late M phase-wherein both positive feedback loops in each module and interactions among modules play important roles. Specifically, when the cell-cycle process operates near the critical points of the saddle-node bifurcations, a critical slowing down effect takes place. Such interregnum then allows for an attractive manifold and sufficient duration for cell-cycle events, within which to assess the completion of DNA replication and mitosis, e.g., spindle assembly. Moreover, such arrangement ensures that any fluctuation in an early module or event will not transmit to a later module or event. Thus, our results suggest a possible dynamical mechanism of the cell-cycle process to ensure event order and dynamic robustness and give insight into the evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle processes."

Yarrowia lipolytica, a nonconventional yeast, is a promising and superior host for plant natural products manufacture, due to its advanced properties compared to conventional hosts. In this review, metabolic engineering approaches recently employed for overproduction of useful plant natural products, including terpenoids and polyketides, in Y. lipolytica are summarized.

E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-overexpressing plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signaling in pepper plants. This article is protected by copyright.

These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:>2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed >400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human-yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context."

The present report describes a new method for bio-detoxification of undiluted fresh OMW based on the driven selection of aerobic yeasts and bacteria. The identified yeast Candida boidinii A5y and the bacterium Paenibacillus albidus R32b strains allowed the treatment of freshly produced raw OMW characterized by very high COD value and phenolic content, when applied as sequential inoculum. The treated OMW showed the absence of antimicrobial effects and a strongly reduction of phytotoxic activity on the germination of several plant seeds. The process was successfully validated on an industrial scale without any pre-treatment, dilution and/or supplementation of the raw waste. Bio-detoxified OMW produced by this sustainable and low-cost process would be suitable for new non-chemical fertigation or soilless applications.

Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity."

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place."

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examine snmp genes of Helicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas. In silico expression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as the B. mori snmp genes, H. armigera snmp1 (Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae. Harmsnmp2 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts. Harmsnmp3 is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels of Harmsnmp2 and Harmsnmp3 differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insect snmp genes and their functions in lepidopterans.

It modifies glycoproteins sent to it from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it recycles ER resident proteins, it sorts proteins destined for the vacuole from secretory proteins, it receives proteins internalized from the plasma membrane and either recycles them to the plasma membrane or re-targets them to the vacuole for degradation. In functional terms the Golgi apparatus can be likened to a car factory, with incoming (COPII traffic) and returning (COPI traffic) railway lines at the entry gate, and a distribution centre (the TGN) at the exit gate of the assembly hall. In the assembly hall we have a conveyor belt system where the incoming car parts are initially assembled (in the cis-area) then gradually modified into different models (processing of secretory cargo) as the cars pass along the production line (cisternal maturation). After being released the trans-area, the cars (secretory cargos) are moved out of the assembly hall and passed on to the distribution centre (TGN), where the various models are placed onto different trains (cargo sorting into carrier vesicles) for transport to the car dealers. Cars with motor problems are returned to the factory for repairs (endocytosis to the TGN). This simple analogy also incorporates features of quality control at the COPII entry gate with defective parts being returned to the manufacturing center (the ER) via the COPI trains (vesicles). In recent years, numerous studies have contributed to our knowledge on Golgi function and structure in both animals, yeast and plants. This review, rather than giving a balanced account of the structure as well as of the function of the Golgi apparatus has purposely a marked slant towards plant Golgi ultrastructure integrating findings from the mammalian/animal field.

32248529,Overexpression of Populus transcription factor PtrTALE12 increases axillary shoot development by regulating WUSCHEL expression.,20200518,"['Bae So-Young', 'Kim Min-Ha', 'Cho Jin-Seong', 'Park Eung-Jun', 'Lee Hyoshin', 'Kim Jeong-Hoe', 'Ko Jae-Heung']","The TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) transcription factor family has been shown to control meristem formation and organogenesis in plants. To understand the functional roles of the TALE family in woody perennials, each of the TALE members of Populus trichocarpa was overexpressed in Arabidopsis as a proxy. Among them, the overexpression of PtrTALE12 (i.e., 35S::PtrTALE12) resulted in a dramatic increase of axillary shoot development with early flowering. Interestingly, expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of both apical and axillary meristem formation, was significantly increased in the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis plants. Conversely, WUS expression was downregulated in 35S::PtrTALE12-SRDX (short transcriptional repressor domain) plants. Further analysis found that PtrTALE12, expressed preferentially in meristem tissues, directly regulates WUS expression in transient activation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PtrTALE12 interacts with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), however, the interaction does not affect the WUS expression. In addition, expression of both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes were suppressed accordingly for early flowering 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis. Indeed, transgenic poplars overexpressing PtrTALE12 as well as Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtBLH11, a close homolog of PtrTALE12, phenocopied the 35S::PtrTALE12 Arabidopsis (i.e., increased axillary shoot development). Taken together, our results suggest that PtrTALE12 functions as a positive regulator of axillary shoot formation in both Arabidopsis and poplar."
32248437,"Functional role of yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, and acetic acid bacteria in cocoa fermentation processes.",20200518,"['De Vuyst Luc', 'Leroy Frédéric']","Cured cocoa beans are obtained through a post-harvest, batchwise process of fermentation and drying carried out on farms in the equatorial zone. Fermentation of cocoa pulp-bean mass is performed mainly in heaps or boxes. It is made possible by a succession of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) activities. Yeasts ferment the glucose of the cocoa pulp into ethanol, perform pectinolysis, and produce flavour compounds, such as (higher) alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids, and esters. LAB ferment the glucose, fructose, and citric acid of the cocoa pulp into lactic acid, acetic acid, mannitol, and pyruvate, generate a microbiologically stable fermentation environment, provide lactate as carbon source for the indispensable growth of AAB, and contribute to the cocoa and chocolate flavours by the production of sugar alcohols, organic acids, (higher) alcohols, and aldehydes. AAB oxidize the ethanol into acetic acid, which penetrates into the bean cotyledons to prevent seed germination. Destruction of the subcellular seed structure in turn initiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions inside the cocoa beans, which provides the necessary colour and flavour precursor molecules (hydrophilic peptides, hydrophobic amino acids, and reducing sugars) for later roasting of the cured cocoa beans, the first step of the chocolate-making."

The current drug regimens are suffering from such drawbacks as drug resistance, toxicity, and costliness; accordingly, they highlight the need for the discovery of novel drug agents. The metabolic adaptability under low-carbon conditions and expression of functional virulence traits mark the success of pathogens to cause infection. The metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate cycle (GC), enable C. albicans to survive under glucose-deficient conditions prevalent in the hostile niche. Therefore, the key enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MLS), represent attractive agents against C. albicans. Similarly, virulence traits, such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation, are the crucial determinants of C. albicans pathogenicity. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to uncover the role of vanillin (Van), a natural food flavoring agent, in inhibiting GC, yeast-to-hyphal transition, and biofilm formation in human fungal pathogen C. albicans."

In this study the inhibition of glucose-induced proton release was determined on the basis of color change of pH indicator, methyl red, from pH 5 to pH6 at cell density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. When yeast cells were incubated with the inhibitors of glucose intake, glycolysis, and plasma membrane H + -ATPase for 1 h, these cytotoxic effects were observed by following the change in absorbance at 527 nm due to methyl red for 5 min. The cytotoxic effects of heavy metal ions, detergents and quinones were observed in the same manner. The above method was superior in sensitivity and measurement time to cell proliferation measurement that required 9 h. This visual cytotoxicity test (methyl red test) is expected to be useful as simple and rapid cytotoxicity test with yeast cells."

32247579,Improvement of Ethanol Tolerance by Inactive Protoplast Fusion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,20200518,"['Xin Yi', 'Yang Mei', 'Yin Hua', 'Yang Jianming']","Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a typical fermentation yeast in beer production. Improving ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae will increase fermentation efficiency, thereby reducing capital costs. Here, we found that S. cerevisiae strain L exhibited a higher ethanol tolerance (14%, v/v) than the fermentative strain Q (10%, v/v). In order to enhance the strain Q ethanol tolerance but preserve its fermentation property, protoplast fusion was performed with haploids from strain Q and L. The fusant Q/L-f2 with 14% ethanol tolerance was obtained. Meanwhile, the fermentation properties (flocculability, SO2 production, α-N assimilation rate, GSH production, etc.) of Q/L-f2 were similar to those of strain Q. Therefore, our works established a series of high ethanol-tolerant strains in beer production. Moreover, this demonstration of inactivated protoplast fusion in industrial S. cerevisiae strain opens many doors for yeast-based biotechnological applications."

In this study, the effect of soybean coinoculation with the N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 and the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Th5cc was analyzed. Nodulation by E109 was not hampered by Th5cc, which antagonized five out of seven soybean pathogens tested. Furthermore, Th5cc relieved nitrate-inhibition of nodulation, enabling the formation of nodules containing infected cells with bacteroids in the presence of the otherwise inhibitory 10 mM KNO3. Th5cc released micromolar amounts of auxin, and addition of 11 μM indoleacetic acid to soybean plants inoculated with E109 in the absence of Th5cc also induced nodulation in the presence of 10 mM KNO3. Thus, Th5cc may release auxins into the soybean rhizosphere, which hormones might participate in overcoming the nitrate-inhibition of nodulation. Our results suggest that soybean plants coinoculated with these microorganisms might benefit from biocontrol while contributing to soil-nitrogen preservation."

Their biological function has been thought to be a consequence of the overall chemical composition. In contrast, here we achieve direct nanoscale visualization of the compositional and structural heterogeneity of the yeast cell wall particles and demonstrate that such nanoscale heterogeneity directly influences the receptor function of immune cells. By combining peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we achieve simultaneous chemical, topographical, and mechanical mapping of cell wall particles extracted from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with ≈ 6 nm resolution. We show that polysaccharides (β-glucan and chitin) and proteins are organized in specific non-uniform structures, and their heterogeneous spatial organization leads to heterogeneous recruitment of receptors on immune cell membranes. Our findings indicate that the biological function of yeast cell wall particles depends on not only their overall composition, but also the nanoscale distribution of the different cell wall components."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway has been involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a method to increase yeast cell permeability in order to study at the molecular level the fate of replication forks blocked by DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). Our results indicate that Rad52 and Rad51 HR factors are required to complete DNA replication in response to CPT. Recombination events occurring during S phase do not generally lead to the restart of DNA synthesis but rather protect blocked forks until they merge with convergent forks. This fusion generates structures requiring their resolution by the Mus81 endonuclease in G2 /M. At the global genome level, the multiplicity of replication origins in eukaryotic genomes and the fork protection mechanism provided by HR appear therefore to be essential to complete DNA replication in response to fork blockage."

In experiment 1, 8 technical lignins and propionic acid (PRP; positive control) were tested at a dose of 40 mg/mL. The experiment had a randomized complete block design (RCBD, 4 runs) and a factorial arrangement of 3 molds × 10 additives (ADV). The effects of the ADV on yeast were evaluated separately with a RCBD. Sodium lignosulfonate (NaL) and PRP were the only treatments with 100 ± 2.8% inhibition of fungi. In experiment 2, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selected lignins and PRP were determined. At pH 4, NaL had the lowest MIC across the molds (20-33.3 mg/mL) and magnesium lignosulfonate (MgL) for the yeast (26.7) among the lignins. However, PRP had MIC values that were several-fold lower across all fungi (1.25-3.33). In experiment 3, a RCBD (5 blocks) with a 3 (ADV; NaL, MgL, and PRP) × 4 (doses: 0, 0.5, 1, and 3% wt/wt fresh basis) factorial arrangement of treatments was used to evaluate the preservative effects of ADV in ground high-moisture alfalfa hay inoculated with a mixture of the fungi previously tested and incubated under aerobic conditions in vitro. After 15 d, relative to untreated hay (14.9), dry matter (DM) losses were lessened by doses as low as 1% for NaL (3.39) and 0.5% for PRP (0.81 ± 0.77%). The mold count was reduced in both NaL at 3% (3.92) and PRP as low as 0.5% (3.94) relative to untreated hay (7.76 ± 0.55 log cfu/fresh g). Consequently, sugars were best preserved by NaL at 3% (10.1) and PRP as low as 0.5% (10.5) versus untreated (7.99 ± 0.283% DM), while keeping neutral detergent fiber values lower in NaL (45.9) and PRP-treated (45.1) hays at the same doses, respectively, relative to untreated (49.7 ± 0.66% DM). Hay DM digestibility was increased by doses as low as 3% for NaL (67.5), 1% MgL (67.0), and 0.5% PRP (68.5) versus untreated hay (61.8 ± 0.77%). The lowest doses increasing neutral detergent fiber digestibility relative to untreated hay (23.3) were 0.5% for MgL and PRP (30.5 and 30.1, respectively) and 1% for NaL (30.7 ± 1.09% DM). Across technical lignins, NaL showed the most promise as a potential hay preservative. However, its effects were limited compared with PRP at equivalent doses. Despite not having an effect on preservation, MgL improved DM digestibility by stimulating neutral detergent fiber digestibility. This study warrants further development of NaL under field conditions."
32246816,Isolation and characterization of Salt Overly Sensitive family genes in spinach.,20200517,"['Zhao Chaoyang', 'William David', 'Sandhu Devinder']","The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.
